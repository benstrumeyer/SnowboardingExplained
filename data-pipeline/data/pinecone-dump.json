      "fullText": "in this video I'm very excited because we're about to Deep dive one of the most important tricks in all freestyle snowboarding and that is the backside 3E 60 your favorite Rider goes and grinds him out I grind him out I probably do 500 to a th000 backside 360s each season and that's because it's such a good trick for going and working on your fundamentals working on your backside takeoffs and it's a building block for every future backside spin making this probably the most done trick it's so important in fact that when I moved to Whistler I was trying back nines I was trying dub back 10 and as soon as I got here my coach was like hey you don't actually know how to spin backside and made me spin backside 360s for 2 months straight just every day every hit backside 360 backside 360 and I'm so glad he did because that's really the process that made me the rider I am today and I know some people he may do this for years at a time and this is because it really teaches you all the fundamental principles that you need to be a super powerful backside Rider and backsides more technical than front side so we focus on the backside 360 more than the front side 360 though both are obviously very important so that said let's start breaking it down I think the best strategy to break this down is we'll go sort of through uh a more rough draft of the important principles to hit and then we'll go and add context to each one of them and just just keep going and see where it takes us because this is one of the tricks that you want to go and really figure out because that's the biggest problem I had with my training with it is I was grinding all these backside 360s but I didn't really know exactly what I was trying to to achieve and what my end goal was so with that in mind let's go and jump right into it backside 360s start where every trick starts and that is the setup carve there's a few key points you're trying to hit on every setup carve and the first one is light heel pressure we want to go and keep our weight primarily set over top of our snowboard if we go and try to lean back too much it's going to make it so we're too far away from our board that's going to make us turn too much and really go and throw us off so we're trying to hold just a little bit of heel pressure while maintaining a nice stale position with our weight primarily set over our board as we're doing this and as we're loading into our heel Edge we're trying to go and keep our chest and hips all pointed towards uh the corner of the jump if you're regular foot and coming in the other way it would be the other Corner you're trying to point your board in the opposite direction about you're spinning the reason why we're doing this is because it opens up your hips it opens your upper body and this gives you more range of motion to snap the spin we'll get more into about a second here we're holding this heel Edge pressure uh when you start the heage pressure doesn't really matter but you want to make sure that you're holding it all the way into right here the spoon of the jump where the jump goes from Flat to uphill uh and the reason why we're holding it there is because the spoon of the jump is where you go and get all the kick all the gForce because you're transitioning from a flat surface to an uphill surface and when you're going and getting that extra GeForce it's really beneficial to be flat-based on your snowboard just helps you absorb it because if you're on a tow Edge at this point it's going to go and put more pressure on it and that's going to make it more likely that you turn over so as we go and transition to our tow Edge we're trying to hit that flat based section through the spoon and as we're going and hitting that flat based section and getting onto our toes that's when we start winding up for the spin we don't want to wind up before going and getting onto our tow Edge because the tow Edge is what lets us grip the snow and it's this gripping of the snow that lets you go and get your hips open get your chest open so if you go and try to open up your chest like this without having that little bit of edge pressure it's going to be really hard to not go and start turning off the slope so wait to do your setup wind up until you go and get onto that tow Edge when on the tow Edge you want to go and try hold your setup position for as little time as possible so once you go and hit your maximum extension you want to start throwing it if you start frowing too soon delay when you're hitting that maximum extension and the throw timing on this is a to go and finish the snap as your tail leaves off the end and the Finish snap on a jump the size isn't actually very significant see how my shoulders are squared arm a little bit leading heads down but I'm not trying to go and look all the way up around the shoulder I'm not trying to over snap it and this is because backside 360s don't actually take that much power you can finish them really well of counter rotation so instead what you want to focus on doing is making sure that you're continuing your rotational momentum what that means is your upper body is continuing to spin until you go and snap off the lip just that little bit of rotational momentum by having that consistency and momentum carrying until your tail snaps off will be plenty of rotation to get most back freeze around once I go and snap off the lip I first go and make sure my core is and control make sure everything's right I didn't get bucked and after that point I go and pull my arm around and pull my head through my spot you're aiming to spot around here right before 180 and you're trying to spot by looking under your arm under that armpit and tracking the whole way the reason why we're doing this is because that's just the fastest possible way you can spot well going and maintaining the center balance see this little bit of Bend forward if this bend my legs this is really important just like when you're riding if you want to go and keep your Center Mass in the same point as your legs come up your chest needs to go forward so the more you pull your legs up towards you the more you need to let your chest go down in correlation the same principles apply when we're in the air because we're trying to rotate over one axis point and that is going to be the balls of our feet we need to go and make sure that we're maintaining our Center balance with our body on that point throughout the full duration of the air and the only way to do that is to make sure that your upper body is coming down in correlation to your legs when done right this is going to also make it so you have a lot of room in the core to go and extend the motion pull through and that's how we can start going and getting this micro adjustment so right here uh my arm is leading theot rotation my chest is open and the reason why this is so important is because of this last section here look at how I finish for rotation with my hips you can tell I'm using counter rotation here because my chest is landing looking forward even though it was connected and this is why we're trying to lead every rotation a little bit with our upper body because just by having my upper body leading the rotation a little bit pulling in with that back arm it gives me ability to use the counter rotation like this and counter rotation has two main purposes is when it comes to Landing backside 360s first you can use it to speed up your spin so if you're under rotating you can use counter rotation to speed it up and second you can use it to preemptively slow down your spin every time you do a spin when you're coming to a landing you're still going to have rotational momentum but counter rotation while it speeds up your rotation it also slows down your rotation velocity and that's why we're trying to use it to go and finish Landing these tricks so that way we're coming into the landing with less rotational velocity making it easier to go and land and right away so here tow Edge and watch my upper body snapping snapping and maintaining the same motion from the takeoff to the lip so even though I'm not snapping hard I'm maintaining a very consistent range of motion and from there all you need to do is pull up your back arm keep leading and then at the end of the trick use that little bit of a shift in the hips that little bit of counter rotation in order to get the landing around you're aiming to land with a slight bit of toe pressure or flat base when you go and under rotate a backside 360 so like if this was under rotated a little bit more you need to be landing on your heel Edge or else you're going to clip your toes and fall forward but if you go and do a backside 360 control your rotation and all your speed you want to land with that little bit of edge pressure uh this is going to be more of a feel thing than something that you can go and just figure out through a lesson it comes from being super comfortable with the motion the snap and the pop now let's go and do a brief section on the grab and after that we'll go and get seriously Tech with it so coming in snapping and the most important thing when you're grabbing a backside 360 is to not rush it you want to do your full grab or your full snap and then after your full snap that's when you pull into grab the grabs an after fought every time doing a backside 360 and you shouldn't be grabbing until you've mastered the trick because there's no reason to once you have a perfect backside 360 you'll be easy to go and add any grab you want so here what's going on basically I set my Axis rotation slightly to dipped and because of that combined with going too big when I come and start finishing the spin uh I'm over I'm fully rotated high in the air and on a slightly off axis but because I was leading the rotation of my upper body I can use counter rotation to slow down my spin and this is a really important principle at retraining on the backside 360s is the ability to go and slow down your rotation finish your rotation all the way and then slow it down if you need to and that's going to be a skill that saves you many slams when you're actually going and learning uh for like smaller jumps same things apply you just go and snap it a little bit harder a little bit faster but you're not trying to go and do a bigger motion you're just trying to do the motion you're doing a little bit quicker flat ground is where this starts getting a little bit more interesting and a little more Tech uh because you don't have that leverage you don't have that pop I don't know if you've ever tried this but try doing a backside free going straight downhill with nothing to pop off of it's really extremely difficult and in order to make up for this we really hyper utilize uh counter rotation and leading with the upper body so to snap a back free on the flat ground I'm rotating my upper body all the way into this point here with my chest rotating 90° more of over my legs this lets me go and immediately utilize counter rotation to go and pull rest of a spin around and that's what's happening right here I'm going and snapping leading up the upper body and instead of relying completely on rotational momentum instead I'm making my primary focus to get a spin around counter rotation and that's generally what you want to do when doing back freeze off rails you can counter rotate up to like 270 so here I'm popping up not rotating with the legs not keeping the core tight just letting the upper body lead and I'm letting it lead up until I can see the landing here and at this point my upper body has so much rotation built up in it that I can go and snap my legs back in line with my core and that's going to be enough to get the spin around and that's just hyper exaggerating the importance of Leaning vent rotation for upper body not worrying about the power power really helps but if you go and use too much power it's going to disconnect you and it's going to go and make it so you don't have that little microcontrol way better to snap a little slower on backside 360 and trust that you can use counter rotation at the end to clean it up when you don't go and lead with your upper body it's going to make it so you don't have any of that micr control coming into the landing so here even though I led the rotation with my upper body at first I went and actively connected my lower body and upper body so right here everything's rotating at the same speed and that makes it so when I come into the landing I don't have any Micro Control so see how my arms and chest are all aligned here and as I land I'm landing with everything together so the reason why I'm landing heel heavy and uh all connected funky here is just because I'm too connected in the core too connected in the lower body uh it's a very dream scenario to be able to do a perfect backside 360 without any micro adjustments and when you're spinning everything all together you don't have any ability to do a micro adjustment spinning everything all together does a couple of things first you obviously don't have that micro adjustment but second you're also fully committed to whatever speed of rotation you set off the lip and this is going to make so if you overshoot the jump that's when you can start rocking over and falling forward because you won't have the ability to slow it down and also if you didn't go and snap hard enough you're going to land under rotated so it makes it so you're completely susceptible to the momentum you set off the LI in a perfect world you'd be able to do this and hold it and land amazingly every time but in reality there's a few too many variables to go and make that a consistent way of doing backside 360s and it's way better to rely on having that upper body lead rotation a bit so you can go and use that little bit of counter rotation to control it into the landing so with that out of the way that is the fundamentals that is the goals of each backside 360 now let's talk about how we train them how we go about it and get a little more in depth on what we're doing so first with a setup carve train your setup carves on mellow slopes going downhill every single chance you get carving the mountain I go and utilize the setup carve so when I finish go the park and a little flat section I practiced doing the setup carve because it's so crucial and the points I'm trying to hit are a few first I'm trying to go and do a smaller heelside transition I don't want to go and be coming all the way from the left all the way to the right because the more sideways momentum you have the harder it's going to be to hold a clean toe Edge so a smaller setup carve not for length of time but for angle is really beneficial and I'm not doing it here but I really recommend starting your setup carve on the far side side of the jump and aiming to do it closer to your spin closer to the center the reason why this is nice is because if you start a little too CL close to the center and when you accidentally do a little too much heel Edge pressure it's going to make it so when you try to go and get onto your toes you're going to be playing with the end of a jump and that can make it so you cut your motion short and I actually have that problem a lot where I'll go and just be slightly too close to the right and I need to go and adjust my setup carb uh the other thing you're really trying to do here is get your upper body angled towards that corner so we're not trying to go and fully wind up like we're going to snap but we want to have our hip slightly open we want to have our chest slightly open and that's because we're trying to keep your board slightly angled towards that corner having the board slightly angled towards that corner is super beneficial because it makes it so as you transition to flat base and Tow Edge you have an increased turn radius an increased turn radius makes it so it's easier to go and hold a straight line from switching from heel side to toes if you're going straight down the fall line and you try to go heels toes it's going to go and make it so you want to slowly turn off but if you go slightly angled heels toes then that slight angle is going to set you up for a straight part going up the jump so it's a very slight it doesn't need to be a big angle too big of an angle will go and make it so you start checking and losing speed through the spoon so a small angle but make sure that your board is slightly angled towards that corner and then for wind up and arm positioning this is pretty important we want to keep our arms pretty much around chest high so see how my arm is like in line with my nipples here uh that's a really good spot for it to be if you have your arms too high or too low it's going to go and affect your axis rotation how you can channel the power so arms too high will make it so as you throw it's going to try to like dip you toss you and arms too low what is something I'm uh I'm bad with especially if it's back arm you can see my back arm is pretty low here I'm working on fixing it uh the day I got this footage I completely forgot about it because it's not natural to me but if you go and have your arm too low it's going to make it so as you go and throw your spin it's angled slightly down and that's where a lot of this slight cork is coming from on my backside 360s is this arm being slightly down because it's here it does something with my shoulders it slightly angles my shoulders this way a slight angle of the shoulders towards your toe Edge we make it so you're on a slight dip and a slight axis whenever you're spinning backside it's better to have your angle rotation set over your back foot and that's because your back foot's the last thing popping off and it sets you up on the proper Arc of the jump so you don't want to be going and setting your rotation too much over your front foot to Center base it should be set slightly over your back foot the angle of the jump lines up really well usually with the angle of the landing so by matching the angle of the jump and snapping your spin on the angle of the jump is going to make it so you naturally come into the angle of the landing what's a what's less true if you're hitting like a really sketchy bump or something but on a well-made jump that's going to be true every time so with fist backside form the only thing I would change here is this arm instead of being down here just move it to light right here it doesn't even need to be right there at this point but the problem is I'm not lifting it to chest level at any point during the snap and that's going should just go and make it so I have this slight dip so you can see my board here is angled more than if angle of a takeoff and that means I'm slightly corking it and that's coming from that front arm being angled slightly downwards all right let's talk about snap momentum and carrying through really quick because this is one of the things that people struggle with the most on backside 360s uh first timing we want to go and try keep our eyes at the end of a takeoff as long as possible this is probably not the right clip to use it we'll go and get to a different CP but the reason why we're trying to keep our eyes to the end of a takeoff is because we don't want to start closing our upper body too soon if you go and close your upper body to the lip of the jump it's going to make it so you start turning off the lip and if you go and turn off a lip it's going to make you drift it's going to make you not fully see where you're don't going and it's going to make it so you break at the waist here you can see I have a little bit of angle of my upper body a little bit of angle fine we don't want to be we don't need to be completely straight in a straight line on on a backside 360 but we need to make sure that this angle is in correlation to a bend in our legs if in this position instead of going here I was like this then what would happen is my rotation when I tried to snap would be set downwards and this is a really important part you're trying to go and only snap on one axis rotation so as I'm snapping I'm not lifting my arms up I'm not trying to pop my arms up so basically like this I'm not trying to go oh snap my whole arms up like this instead I'm trying to match a single axis of rotation and commit to it so here if my upper body was angled over here and I tried to go and do the same arm snap around it would be sending my throw down into the snow so the limit to how much angle you can have in your upper body while going and snapping the backside 360 is how much you can go and angle yourself while still maintaining a constant snap of access because if you're Bend too far forward as you snap your spin you're going need to straighten yourself back out if that's going to go and make it so you're rotating on two axis of rotation you're rotating up and you're rotating across where we really just want to be rotating across on the single smooth Arc and that's just going to do a lot to go and help power and consistency so this one we can do spotting a bit better oh first I need to point something out here look at how I pre-op off this jump uh pre- popping off a jumps a really good sign that you went and did something early and you're not relying on maintaining board contact with a lip and it just snap you off this one I have a bit of an excuse for this jump had a double lip you can't really see it but the takeoff on this jump was actually here uh just because of how they groined the jump what's what happens sometimes it's hard Grom jumps so we'll go and ignore that but you want to make sure that you're maintaining contact with the jump as long as possible so what's happening I'm coming in on my heel Edge and see how my hips chest and upper body are all angled and now let's go and isolate our Focus to head positioning see how my head is spotted more towards the corner of the jump if my eyes were spotted over here towards the center what's that going to do it's going to make it so my chest wants to rotate towards that point so by going and actively putting your spot slightly more to the right and feels natural you'll go and increase your range of motion and the whole reason we're going increasing range of motion by opening our upper body opening our hips is because it makes it so we have more room to go and snap the spin more room to snap the spin is really beneficial because it lets us get more forgiving of our timing if you go and finish like snapping the spin right here so like you're completely finished snapping but you're still on the takeoff that's going to make it so when you leave the takeoff you actually don't have any rotational momentum how rotating backside on a jump works works is if you go and stop your rotational momentum at any point on the takeoff you're not caring about rotational momentum you're only rotating as fast as the last Point your body was snapping as your tail leaves off a jump so if you snap really fast slow it down it's going to be a slow throw if you snap really fast and stop it and then try to muster around some more power you're going to be only froing from that last little bit of mustard power all right sorry a little bit of a tangent there let's get back actually this head position so I'm keeping my head spotted at the corner as I open my chest I'm keeping it spotted and as I start frilling the spin my head is still there I'm trying to track it all the way as my foot passes it so see how my foot's going past and now my head's still on that point and I start going and continuing to track it right here so at 90° my head still at the takeoff so you're basically tracking the takeoff and trying to keep your head in that relative position until you snap off uh but that's a little bit of a oversimplification so my head is now positioned at where the takeoff is like it looks like I'm looking back at the takeoff but there's actually no purpose in looking at the takeoff at this point once your front foot has left the takeoff right here there's no point to be looking at it so instead of going and looking straight back at the takeoff at this point instead I'm just keeping my head in the general area while looking down it's very subtle but the difference is if you have your head looking over at the takeoff here it's going to make it so your upper body wants to lean forward and your set enter balance is going to be a little bit too much towards that point because wherever you look your body will angle to compensate so in order to make up for this we just keep our head in the general ey area so instead of looking straight at the takeoff instead I'm looking just straight down uh closer to my feet wherever takeoff was but it no longer is again we're trying to go and keep as stable of a head position as possible the more head movement you do the harder it's going to be to track your movements and keep control of what you're doing so we're trying to keep a very stable head trying to limit the amount of movements so the only head movement I'm going to be doing here is at this point right here I go and pull my head around and pull my arm around leading with a back arm is really important because that's going to be what's responsible for leading your rotation this is why like indie stalefish uh no sorry just Indie grab this is why Indie grabs are really tough on backside 360s because it's going to make it so you can't lead with that uh back hand and if you can't lead on the back hand it's going to be a lot harder to use counter rotation so if you see anyone doing it Indie grab on a back free and relacing it that's a flex and yeah we won't talk too much more about the slat ground one but obviously if you're trying to get more power more snap you're going to want to lead with your upper upper body more this is more similar to a snap that I'd be doing for like a backside 900 on an actual jump with the chest leading and then trying to catch up with a lower body uh so on a backside 360 you generally don't need to leave that much of upper body because like I said you can go and rotate so much of counter rotation and you can get so much power just by Leading with that back arm and tightening your core and pulling through but learning that skill and learning how to do on flat ground will really help when you go to bigger spins we'll talk about that more another video but we'll end this off with just a little recap recap you want to come in from the far side of a jump and be in a nice position with your legs having bent your torso over your board we don't want to be too tall in this position a nice bent position is going to make it easier to hold Edge pressure while keeping yourself centered over your board we're doing a light heel Edge not trying to cut across the slope too much but just trying to go and get our hips open upper body open towards the corner of the jump we go and hold this position until the spoon of the jump at which point we switch to flat base and after we go and finish going through the spoon we then dig in our toe Edge and as we dig in our toe Edge we go and open our hips open our upper bodies and wind up for the spin pulling that knee in as we go and finish that motion that's when we start snapping the spin while trying to maintain our eye contact at the end of a jump as close to where we're taking off as possible not keeping our eyes all the way at the center but instead trying to keep your eyes towards where your board's taking off we hold our spot there all the way into our tail snaps off the end at which point we go and take our head and pull the spot underneath the arm it's really important to spot underneath the arm on every single spin as you spot under the arm we making sure that you're keeping your center of balance over the balls of your feet by having your upper body come down in correlation to your legs that's when you go and use counter rotation when needed to either speed up or slow down your rotation from there you aim to land both feet at the same time and then dig in that tow Edge in order to fully stop for momentum and if you're under rotating you need to go and make sure you land on your heels and we want to do this all when not break an the waist making sure that we're maintaining a strong powerful position that lets us rotate and generate our power through one access rotation and when all that's done in correlation you're going to land a freaking amazing backside 360 that doesn't mean though it's not going to take some work like I said I do 500 to a th000 of these per year and I've done so many grinded so much and I spend a lot of time thinking about it because this trick is the base of any backside spin you go and get a masterful backside free60 back fives and back sevens are going to be so much easier to learn so give it a go let me know how it treats you and thank you so much for watching I'll watch one more to end it why not we're already at Fair minutes oh I'm sorry for a long video it's just it's an important topic needs to be done sometimes you know all right I'm a good one",

And the way we're going to train this is with backside 180s. So, whenever you're rotating on a trampoline, you want to have the middle of the trampoline set as the knuckle of the jump. For those of you that don't know, when you're rotating a trick, you're trying to keep your eyes at the knuckle of the jump. And if you're going and landing blind going up to the jump, you want to land looking back uphill at that knuckle. And if you're doing something like a backside 360, you want to have your vision go and pull all the way past that. But on a trampoline, we're not traveling forward. So that means our vision is going to be set right in the center of us. So pick the center of the trampoline. That's the knuckle of the jump. And I'm actually going to be holding my head in that position for all my tricks. So if I do like a seven, see how my head's locked in that one position, and it's not moving around. This is the key to fluid spins on your snowboard and on the trampoline. and that is minimizing the head position. When we're doing tricks, we're not trying to go and throw our head into them.

I'm going plan going to a right side ice match here \nflat base. Slow down. And now I can straight bomb through here because I see the smells good. \nDepending on the lighting, this is going to be a lot harder. And that's why bad lighting \nand bad ice are the double combo that really makes snowboarding tricky, no matter how good you \nare. We're getting into a mogul field and this is perfect for what I'm trying to demonstrate. Way \ntoo icy throughout the sections. I can't hold an edge at all. This is a sketchy situation. Let me \ngo and demonstrate first how to get up if you fall because falling is going to happen when you're on \nice like this. So, if I fall here and get slipping on my bum, I don't want to try jar my legs forward \nto stop it. Here, it's working because it's not so steep. I actually want to pull my legs into me \nlike this. So, I'm on my back and I'm pulling my legs into me. So, I'm in this strong position \nhere. And that's going to let me absorb it. Like here, I can really dig in my foot. I can use my \nhands. That's going to let me control it. And that's why we want to be a little more crouched \ndown when we think we could be falling so we don't get the wind shook out of us and slam and need to \nnavigate. Now just keeping my board, keeping over top of my board, watching where I'm going. And \nthe important thing here is like ride for what the conditions offer. I'd love to lay some really \nlong turns, but instead I got to stay stacked, control speed, put my weight really solid over \ntop of my board by pulling my upper body forward, shifting the hips back, and that's going to \nlet me navigate this terrain a lot easier and being safe this early season. That's \nthe most important thing. This is the time of year where you can get hurt and get \nbucked for absolutely no good reason. So, you want to go live by these same principles. \nLook where you're going. Don't lean away from your snowboard. And lead the turns through weight \nshifting instead of going and putting yourself in a compromised space. Oh my god. And don't lower \nyour guard. If you do that, you should be able to navigate bad terrain and the early season \nwith relative ease. Relative is a key word",

      "fullText": "By holding your spot uphill, locking in that blind landing position is going to let you fully disperse your rotational momentum, letting you go and lock in that toe edge and not slipping out to heels. So, if you're struggling at landing your blind landing tricks, focus on holding that blind landing longer than feels comfortable because it's going to help a million. If you go and hit something with sideways momentum, that momentum is going to carry you all the way off. This is why it's really important to take as straight of an angle as you can into the feature. Because by keeping a straight angle, you're going to minimize your sideways momentum. There's things you can do to stop your momentum, like catching the rail, landing angled, but by limiting your angled approach, it's going to make it so you have to do way less to kill that momentum, making it way easier to lock in and slide to the end of any feature. Whenever you're riding the park, you want to maintain a little bit of bend in your legs and a little bit of forward lean in your upper body. This keeps you balanced and in control and lets you go pop up, get wild with it, have fun with it. So, every time you're in the park riding, try to keep yourself a little bit bent, a little bit lean forward, because I'm telling you, it's going to make a world of difference. Because if you go ride too tall, too straight, you're going to be flatfaced, unbalanced, susceptible to falling. But as you go and keep that little bit of hinge, little bit of bend, even as you pull from keeping that little bit of bend, that's how you get control. That's how you get style.

And that's one of the main reasons when you come off a lip, your upper body is so down. And that's because you weren't starting from a tall enough, strong enough position. We can even see this on your backside 360. If we go fast forward to the start, as you go and transition from your heel edge to toe edge, first the transition is happening really quick. You don't have much time in this flatbed uh section. And when you go and rock to your toe edge from heel edge quick, it's going to put more pressure onto your toe edge. Think of sideways momentum, heel edge, toe edge. The faster you do it, the more it's going to go and put pressure onto your toe edge. And the more pressure you have in your toe edge, the more it's going to want to break you over. Then you're doing something else here that's really hindering you. And that is you're adding bend to your torso and bend to your legs while you're going and winding up for your jump. If we compare our forms here, we can see that you're crouched over, bit of bend in the legs, bit of bend in the torso, and almost completely squared in the hips, knees, and board. If we compare it to mine, we can see that my chest is open, my hips are open, and my board is slightly angled towards the corner of the jump. This is increasing the range of motion I have in my upper body, allowing me to go and do a smoother snap while maintaining this nice tall position. We don't need to be ridiculously tall on a backside 360. We can see that I'm still a little bit hinged forward, but I'm not so hinged forward that my sideways throw is going to start being angled downwards. And that's really the key. We need to make sure that our momentum and our throw is being set across our body and not down towards the snow. Because as you're coming in and snapping the spin, because you don't have much range of motion, you don't have much room to generate power.",

We're building pressure throughout our board, maintaining it so our board holds the same angle as the takeoff the whole way until our tail snaps off the end. That's where the power comes from on a front side spin, not by going and jumping up your legs because that's going to throw off your timing and elongate you. So, how can you train this at home? Go enter this super stack position, chest over knees. This position seems exaggerated, but it's not. It's very crucial when we're doing this. We need to make sure that our upper body isn't leaning more forward and our leg we're not holding oursel too straight. The hinge in your hips should be in correlation to the bend in your legs. How much bend do you want? just enough to go and get the weight onto the balls of your feet. So you're doing a slight slight toe edge turn. From there, once we go through with a spoon of a jump, we shift slightly flat base and then to our heels. And as we get on our heels, we go and wind our arms back up. And then to practice the throw, we want to delay this because if you do it too soon, you're going pre- spin. So delay it a little bit, probably longer than you think. And then rotate with those hips, rotate with the chest, followed with the upper body, finishing this 90 stance.",

trick like this is it so much commitment like you either land that trick or you get slammed there's no in between so trying to learn something like that you have to be really confident uh I don't know

a chair going like this this is so gnarly popping up 180 so one 80 not too Tech but just the switch riding and the switch in is really gnarly like yeah I don't I don't know what makes you want to go and drop in like that but the actual trick itself is very simple popping up and something really important here is look at how much he's leading with his upper body this is because he's disconnected with his legs so he can't go and snap it like a spin plus he's traveling an uncn amount of distance like he doesn't really know how big he's going to go so rotating with the upper body like this makes it so you can go and use counter rotation for the spin so here you can see he still hasn't rotated at all but his upper body has almost completely rotated 90 this makes it so as he's going through the trick he can spot and then pull his legs to him using counter rotation and counter rotation also works to go and slow down your spin making it so it's easier to ride I don't think that trick would be possible if you tried to do it as a backside 180 with rotation you need to make sure it's fully counter rotated Dusty Hendrickson the sleepiest seiest guy around I that's just a back free Miller flip but like done to the absolute maximum you could do it uh let's hopefully get a replay on that that was like I know how these work but I'm not I don't know how sorry I don't know how you send it with that much commitment get that hand like I think if your hand doesn't touch you you're pretty boned maybe you'd flip all the way through maybe he's not too reliant on the hand so the fundamental principle of this is not throwing it like a 360 because you really need to get up and over your tail so we'll go and take a quick look at that so he's popping it and you can see that he's really shifting his whole weight in his upper body backwards and that's making it so it froze a bit more like a flip and a spin what's really important when you're trying to get that inverted in order to get back to your feet so he's dropping that shoulder and keeping his chest forward and this is something that's really interesting uh with these kind of Maneuvers I haven't figured this out yet but it's the ability to keep the eyes forward as you're like rotating this front roll so let's go and break that down and see how he's keeping his head looking forward as he's dropping his shoulders like a front flip so head forward yeah so it's all seems like he's tiling his body on that angle and that makes it so as he front flips he's able to see where he's going that's very Tech uh that's so sick see always spotting forward that whole time he's not blind for any point of this he's in complete and utter control that's just perfectly done yeah eyes forward and look at his eyes oh my God see that's what you want to do I need you to try to figure out that motion I have no idea how he do that front flip motion though with that chest open yeah I don't get it Ze pal always want to watch Super Famous my mom's a teacher and her kids don't really snowboard but they know Zeb pal they're like Zeb Pal's top free snowboards in the world uh I w't go that far he's very fun to watch but it's pretty wild the Zeb hype like sick dude like him but he's really popular for like not being a traditional like you know Park border or like Back Country he's really just doing his own thing making his way and bringing more people into his sport so that's absolutely awesome so this trick is really cool for like back slide I really liked Nev zev's tricks with knuckle hu I think it was actually like one of his best performances uh so here coming up and this is just like trusting that you can get to your back what's really aning about zeb's backslide is he's not wearing like a proper jacket I don't think so he's really risking snowburn so an important part of him is making sure he's on upper shoulder so his coat doesn't go and ride up and from there he's doing this just like you would a front free keeping your eyes forward keeping everything in line and he's going and poking out his legs and getting his hand in here that hand down is probably pretty important for getting back to the feet and yeah from there you're just trying to keep your head positioned right keep your core connected enough and you should be able to get to your feet pretty mellowly the impressive part is how fast he managed to go and hit it Liam brayy here uh I know Liam and I know that we're not going to be able to do this trick even if we understand this trick completely it's not going to be possible for us to do that's just Liam's so Tech front side Miller flip to Method so the reason why this trick is so ridiculously difficult is because the method is trying to continue your rotation so as he pops up into his Miller flip he's going and getting his hand down like you do for a front Miller front Millers are a crazy trick in themselves pretty gnarly getting great extension hitting the grab when he's doing it and when you're doing this your rotation is continuing but as he switches for that method normally this would go and continue your spin because you're letting your upper body continue rotating but because of how he pokes it out and tweaks it it stalls for rotation so his upper body is rotating as he's stalling out the rotation hitting that perfect method and perfect rotation I honestly think that was like that was my favorite trick of the night I think absolutely mindblowing dunge Perfection and that's just warm up for him but I just that's one of the sickest things ever do that off of a powder pillow into in like a powder movie it's going to be it would be insane like you drop that trick anywhere any film part any situation that's like an insane trick so sick all right helor dude helor is such a legend and I love that he brought his like goggle hair stac vot helor could honestly really use a bit of a better fashion like his pants are too skinny I don't know what's going on with that but VRI is more than making up for it vri's freaking so gnarly he's literally just doing a side slip is he actually letting his toe catch no he's popping he's not toe catching okay I originally thought he was like legit letting himself toe sneg and get tossed but this makes more sense uh so he's basically just holding a sid slip and you know when you side slip and you get that like chunder that makes your legs go he's basically going with that chunder getting that pop and you can see he is extending and popping his legs quite a bit while keeping his toes pointed up in order to avoid the toe catch and that's why he's getting this elongated Arc and this is really important when you're doing a trick like this with a lot of forward momentum because you want your momentum to be going up not out just straight out momentum is going to be really hard to control know what that's freaking sick extension I didn't see that in the full speed but look at him that's full penguin full chill see that's why like sometimes you don't fully appreciate these tricks and you hit the full slowmo uh one of the big things that I think made it so he didn't land this is the fact that he did that pop and wasn't much of a lip it made it so he still went really far compared to how much he went up and that makes it really hard to land the tricks so I think if that like had a little more kick on that roller that would have been no problem for him but look at you're literally like lawn darting makes it really hard to spot sick trick T see man how do you tame dog that easily man I don't I don't got tame dogs they sketch me out we won't Deep dive this one nollie duve back 10 uh it's ridiculous but basically you're trying to go and do a du back 10 where you're keeping connected for the first 180 uh it's honestly just too complex but it looks to me like he's just throwing a normal back 10 where he's really making sure to keep that nose on the ground I wouldn't be like he's really has really good nose control that's why he can do that like on the snow thing so he's really good at jumping off that nose I think that trick is probably pretty natural for him oh my God yeah this trick insane uh I've been thinking about this trick a lot and think I'm very strongly determined to never try it uh it is really gnarly so look at how much he's going and putting his weight onto his front foot this is needed to be done he's on a stiff board in order to press this board this much on the nose ripping his fast that's really tough like I don't think I could even I would even be confident I could hold a nose press across the slope let alone back flip out so this fact that is Shifting his hips getting his whole body in there and still lining himself out to do a flip after is wild and let's see us pop so yeah just just a normal straight up gnly but where he's letting his upper body twist so what seems to be the really important part of this trick is making sure that the Torso is completely out horizontal and the legs are really like moving so normally when you're think about snowboarding you know you're trying to keep everything stacked aligned everything over the center of your snowboard but here it seems like there's a lot of advantage to leaning forward I actually experienced this a bit uh when I was in Japan I was going and practicing doing my wild cats and having my hips forward trying to learn how to do that front roll I found that if you put your chest forward it was really easy to get like a smooth rotation where you could spot pretty soon and get less pop it'd be interesting to compare that to how he normally does wild cats sometime because uh that's definitely I wonder if it's just for this trick or that's just like his Wildcat Ste anyway outrageously impressive but basically he's doing a lot Wildcat without any leg motion just whole upper body well being hinged forward crazy athletic feet I honestly don't really know this dude very well but perfect Style on the dub nollie back 10 uh yeah nothing nothing to dislike about that is Kit is sick yeah not sure who that guy is oh yeah Dusty with a tail slide tame dog uh one of the coolest tricks ever uh one of the ogs he's just done it before so it's not as hype as it used to be but it's still outrageously hype like so stey so flowy like and it looks like it has good advant like you're sort of peing popping but risky part is because you're taking off at such a narrow point it makes it extremely gnarly and like precise if you mess up it's going to be like exaggerated Zeb coming in the long board okay this trick is insane this is the whole reason I wanted to make this video was this trick because I don't I don't get what's happening here like the reaction to this one wasn't that big but to me I'm I'm blown away so let's try to figure out what is actually going on here here the video is pretty getting pretty long so this will be the last trick we cover even though there's okay maybe we got to find Liam One More okay so he's coming in really extending his body and leaning forward uh he's doing this so he's just like getting lower to the ground but you can see not breaking up the wa still keeping a strong form so even though he's this lean forward that's still a really powerful takeoff that's going to generate a lot of power and he's not really going and flipping down instead he's relying on putting his body on the angle preemptively and then trying to twist his body around into that that's insane uh okay venny is putting his hands down in a full like back handspring with his board twisted and then I think he twists it back okay we gota watch this again I still don't know what's going on okay okay so front foot here he's taking off front foot body rotated completely 90 his body is rotated 90 so his chest is already forward facing the knuckle from there he's going and trying to kick his legs over his head and because his chest was facing the knuckle that's causing him to rotate giving him the ability to set down his hands in this hand drag position so even though this is a very exaggerated position uh his body was preemptively set up for it so it wouldn't seem as intense as it is and at this point his boards rotated a completely 180 so here the boards rotated 180 in the other direction so counter rotated his body is 90 so here his body is basically not rotating it's rotating like 200° as the board's rotating a complete 180 so a lot of his rotation is only happening from the board that upper body itself isn't actually rotating and then here the board continuing to rotate great body flexibility having his board rotate like 270 sorry I'm getting tripped up again D did I get tripped up no okay tail rotated 180 yeah tail rotated 270 he just like he like whips his hips around and reconnects them so even though he's like so counter rotated yeah he does a full hip swivel look at this his hips are doing a full 360 swivel that's insane no wonder that didn't make any sense I didn't really think about this before but he counter rotated and rotated his upper and lower body so independently he was able to swivel them around putting him back into that 360 position here and from there he's doing a free 60 out so oh my God I don't know if I got this guys I don't know if I got this okay okay one more time bindings down toes facing the ground flipping over yeah you can see his heels is rotating through 360 and then around again so I think this is a 720 where like the upper body is only rotating a 360 I'm going to need some people to like give me their opinions on this because I'm still pretty confused but my best guess is you're taking off leaning forward rotating your up body what makes sense is if this would like work as a full 180 you know yeah so consider about a 180 and then swiveling the hips around 360 and then using continued rotation to finish it off with another 360 so it's so prety it turns into a continued rotation that is really cool with that in mind let's watch it full speed one more time and we'll end this video because my brain is officially melted uh I'm not trying about trick I do not understand that trick well enough no way I could visualize that thing like I'm hardly even understanding what's going on and that's the power of Zeb just like does some stuff that just doesn't make sense and it just but very cool oh I feel more confused I think actually I think I'm more confused if I had to try that trick before making this video and after think I'd have a higher chance before no he definitely rotates back over way man I'm sorry for the confusion guys yeah hates shows I don't got this knuckle hook stuff X Games save that invite I'm I'm not worthy these guys earned it man okay well we're going to end the video on that Liam if he landed that trick would have been the greatest knuckle trick of all time Miller flip double Miller flip uh I've never seen that before anyway thanks for watching guys uh let me know if you like this kind of video happy to do more uh I basically do this for myself anyway I just it's interesting to look at this stuff so yeah enjoy we talk to you next time",

      "fullText": "But go do the push test, get someone to push you, do your hops, see which foot you slightly favor. You will find your correct foot given time. So don't worry about it too much and just try to go and start off with that little bit of information. The most important thing to figure out is the width of stance that works best for you. But the principle to base your stance around is the stack position. Snowboarding is based around the stack position where your weight set over the balls of your feet. That's where you'd like jump off your toes. And the reason why it's based off that is because it holds a little bit of edge pressure, gives you cruise. So you want to stance that lets you hold this position naturally and comfortably. So if we go too narrow and try to do that, it's going to make it so as we squat down, our knees come in and we're not able to get fully out. If we go too wide, we're not going to be able to stand fully straight. And when we stand down, our knees are going bowy out. So, we're trying to find that stand foot that goes and lets us come down and have our knees go down in an even keel. And generally, you can use a forehand trick for this. So, like that's a narrow stance, that's a long stance, that's a mediumly wide stance, and then anywhere between this zone is usually pretty good. Reference on your board is going to be pretty good for you. So, play around with it. Find your comfortable range of motion and play around with your snowboard. Find that position that you feel like you could hold all day while going and jumping off the balls of your feet. The main reason you want more angles on your bindings is so you have more rotation to open your hips. And the main downside is it's going to put more wear and tear in your knees, more wear and tear on your ankles and make it so you have to ride in this more committed position. So the more squared off and straight you have your feet pointed, the more relaxed neutral you want. Too straight, you're going to be too neutral. So having a little bit of shift is going to go and give you the benefits of being able to open your hips. So like turning, it's really important to open your tips and it's going to let you go and maintain a steady position that's not going to put wear and tear on your joints. A great way to go and feel your stance is to go get the general sense of where it's at and just to do a little hops hops into your position and trying to get a range of motion where you feel like you can fully extend, come down and catch yourself in that zone. It's really going to depend on what you like personally. Wider stance, you're going to land more. More narrow stance, you're going to have more range of motion and faster whipping. Somewhere in the middle is going to be good for pretty much everything. My recommendation is the four-bolt system. It has less adjustability on how wide you can make your stand and how narrow you can make it, but it more than makes up for it with being able to secure your bindings on and not need to deal with them getting loose and slipping. What's a super common problem with ESTs when you're going and putting on your bindings, you have this thing here, and this determines the angle that your bindings will be angled at. How it works is it starts baseline 0 0 and you want to rotate it until it's on the angle you want. So here if I'm setting up a board posy pausy I put it on 18 and that's going to make it so the four bolts sync up on the angle that it's set on. And this is a really important part of getting the bindings on because if you don't go and put the bindings on the right angle for what you're trying to do, you're not going to be able to get the bolts to line up. So, I go and get it slightly tight on each one of the four screws and then go and rotate in a circle getting it tighter and tighter.",

making it so that you don't have enough range of motion to fully utilize your snap making you rely on counter rotation and overextension to get the spin around as you rotate your upper body you generate rotational momentum and as long as your upper body continues to rotate that rotational momentum continues to build but as you go and hold your upper body and hold it in a standstill position you're not actually generating any more rotational momentum from this position so you're instead basically going and taking off a jump from a fully wound up position without having any range of motion to generate your spin this makes it so you can do two things one you can either overextend your throw trying to throw past the point your body feels naturally comfortable and strong in in order to use the limited range of motion you have left in your upper body to generate more rotational force in order to get the spin around this leads to overextension and disconnection of the core making it very hard to control the spin and hit a grab having your upper body open will also make it so your legs want to follow leading to pre-spin as you go and pre-spin off off the Jump it's going to make it so your body continues to rotate and if your body rotates too far past your neutral position your head won't be able to stay spotting in front of you and instead it'll be spotting back at the lip of the jump making it impossible to utilize the constant spot and blind Landing this results in Need You Go fling around your legs and makes you not be able to control the spot and control your rotation what you want to be doing is staying as closed off as possible giving you the largest possible range of motion because the faster you can leave off a takeoff with your upper body continuing with rotation the more rotational Force you're going to generate allowing you get more control bring in your grab and feel completely at ease in the air there's two things that generally cause people to make this mistake the first has to do with your setup carve a lot of people will get onto your heels too soon and open the chest and if you open the chest on your heel too soon it's going to cause you to rotate off a jump and if you're going and having your chest already pre open and on your heels it's not going to give you much power to go and generate rotation that's why we want to go and slow down our Edge change and time it for a spoon of a jump so more time on the toes flat face then the heels and as I switch to my heels I go and load up my shoulders into my Max close off closed off position so you're coming in tow Edge heel Edge then close off this gives you a lot more active range of motion to use to snap the spin compared to if you get onto your heels with your chest open you're only going to have this much range of motion to use and that's going to make it really hard to go and gener rate the rotational forces needed to get the 360 around first if you're on your Edge too early it's going to make it so your chest opens and if you want to hold the spot you got to counter rotate the other option is you get on your Edge too soon and you're going try muster through and that's going over juice you I'll demonstrate again here if you go and pop too much you're not going to get any power you're going pre Spin and that's going to make it so you have to look over your shoulder and that's where you see these loose front side Landings coming from the first thing we're going to do is make sure to delay our carve and make sure we're winding up proper so delaying delaying winding up popping off at tail with a smooth transition here again delay into a fra spoon then pop up and see how I'm keeping my chest pointed out to the jump I don't want to rotate it more than by having my chest come out forward facing if you go and try to rotate your chest too much it's going to disconnect you that's why our key rotation point is basically board slide position board slide wind up keep it going rotating Morin that is going to disconnect you when you go and over snap your spin it's going to elongate you and that's going to make it so it's hard to keep everything tight how rotations work in snowboarding is you have your stack position and rotating through that position is how you hold power so I want it we needed one of those needed one of those ah I deserve that that's what I get for making that video and never catch your Edge again anyway back to focusing it's through rotating through this one constant point will keeping us bend the core that we can get our power so our maximum range of motion is how much we can snap while maintaining this tension in our core if that lets us get power so if we try to pop up fully extend it's going to rotate us around but it's going disconnect us making it impossible to grab but if we go and pop up keep everything tight that's give us that microc control and just the ability to really see where we're going and control our snowboard the fix for this is delaying your setup carve as long as possible you want to start transitioning edges through a spoon of a jump so I'm coming through a spoon bent them on my heels and that lets me pop up and get that clean pop will keep my spot forward so the more range of motion you have the more you'll be able to pop up and control it so for here I'm going to close off pop up and that lets me stay in touch maximizing your range of motion so you can maximize your power without overextending yourself and that's what lets you give these clean easy front freeze where you can keep your spot on the same point the whole way for front side 180 if I go and rotate my upper body like this I can pop it up and counter rotate through but if I go and continue a slight bit of momentum then I can keep everything connected and staying stacked this is the same thing we see on H happen on 360s when people try to rotate a front free but rotate don't SP up her body early and going try pop it up and we got to Sprint it around losing the spot but if you go and continue your momentum through that's what lets you pop up without needing to utilize that counter rotation counter rotation is a great tool but how does it works is it first speeds up your rotation so at 180 it speeds it up but then it stops it after that 180 point so you can use counter rotation completely for like a 180 but on something like a fre 60 when you try to use some counter rotation you're going to max out at at 180 point and what you need to avoid is going in snapping too soon stopping making you need to ah try Fring around will lose your spot lose your core engagement and make the front freeze so much harder instead try to go and continue that energy snap through and that's going to let you pop up and get that smooth control letting use counter rotation for the last little bit of a spin besides just stopping rotation this is really hard for spotting controlling your front freeze when you go and activate counter rotation to pull everything together you'll need to come up and look over your shoulder and that's why you see people Landing looking straight downhill if I try to use counter rotation with my upper body it's going to make me land like that see how that's disconnecting my body making me look over my shoulder really what you want to be doing is trying to channel this energy all the way through hitting that position and watching it so you pick a point in front of you try match up that pop and keep your eyes on it the whole way and that's what gives you the control and fluid rotation that let you spot the whole way if you're not feeling ready for a jump you can do this off of Just side rollers is coming up winding up and using that motion trying to make it as smooth and relaxing as possible to get this front free around really smooth through that transition use the whole chest pop up get that grab and not rush it keeping everything calm and in control it's the best way to do it we'll end here with a tail press thank you so much for watching and we'll be back at it with another video soon",

And that's making it so he has no control and no power. So keeping this hinge forward in the upper body is not only increasing range of motion, but it's also keeping your balance point set over the balls of your feet. And that's the key to getting these rotations. You want to go and have an upper body angle that lets you go and do a few things. First, it lets you go and hold your heel edge with minimal motion. So, here I'm leaning a little bit, but I'm squatting down quite a bit and pulling my upper body forward, letting me get this heel edge angle with minimum leaning. Because if you're leaning on your heel edge, you'll have to lean just as much on your toe edge in order to rebalance. And then I'm maintaining this angle on the toe edge while opening up. Never trying to open so far that I get straight over top of my board because that's going to make it so I no longer have my chest over my knees. And then this position right here is the perfect position for me because it lets me go and snap my spin all the way through on the same plane. So see how my upper body is rotating through the same direction the whole way. So even though it's crouched down and the froze seems a little bit down, because it's continuing on an even path, it's going to flow really naturally into a really solid spin.

But this line of dispersing that momentum, goes a little bit toe heavy, more towards flat base, more towards that normal stack position, just dispersed so cleanly.

But if I go and pop up fully extend like this, then I need to spend time coming back into that position. So when you're training this throughout the summer, think about what position you want to be in the air. Try to assimilate as much as it as much of it as you can off snow on the ground training it. Just by spending 5 minutes, 10 minutes a day, not even just 10 minutes a week working on your counter rotation throughout the summer, the muscle memory and the work you're putting in is going to pay off so much in the winter. I practice stuff like this all the time throughout the summer and it's a really big reason why I'm able to go and ride with the efficiency I can. So, I highly recommend taking some of these exercises, playing around with them, just getting comfortable with the idea of counter rotating your body and rotating throughout that stacked point. You do that and it's going to make it so when the season rolls over, you're going to be shredding like never before. Thanks for watching.

This was a little bit hard to implement because he was very confused on just how bent down you're really supposed to get yourself and how squatted into a position you want to be and how early on. The coaching technique that I used to help this sink in for him is I told him to think of like a Japanese euro carver, how they get really down low onto their edge in order to go and get those deep, deep turns. You actually want to be doing the same thing on your setup carve initially for the heel edge. Trying to sink all the way down. The reason why is the more you sink down and the more you squat down, the more heel edge pressure you can put in without needing to rely on leaning. And that was one of the big problems we had with Ben because of his posture is he was needing to rely on leaning his whole body in order to hold that edge pressure that he needed. So it' make it so he had to lean to his heels, lean to his toes. And because he wasn't adding enough bend to his legs, he was staying straight using that little bit of lean. And that's making it so it's too flat base to grip in an edge and actually dig in. And if you can't dig in your edge, you're going to get this little bit of slip. So here we just spent the day working on that. And I just spent every time like Ben more down, more squatted. And we can start seeing that he's doing it better here.",

      "fullText": "And I do this also before every double back 10. I close my eyes and just think like, okay, snap, pull, snap, pull. So, it's really something that's helped me a lot is getting that motion of feeling that motion, feeling that snap, then closing my eyes and trying to add that feeling into the trick. Uh, for the cab 9, when I went and tossed it, I went and popped it. And then as I pulled my head into that position, that's very similar to the dubback 10. I then felt that comfort and it then I could see the landing. And from there I was able to trust because I already felt out that process. And now let's talk a little bit of how we can deal with this fear and how much fear is too much. Because even though we'll all have that little bit of anxiety, that tight chest, that like bit of doubt in the mind, it's really important to know how much of it's reasonable and how much of it's unnecessary. So, what I like to do or this is set a couple rules and go and try to simplify tricks into the most basic principles possible. So, the first rule if I'm doing something like a dub back 10, I have a rule that I have to do two perfect back sevens in a row before trying it. Because the thing I'm worried about the most on a dub back 10 is that I'll go and mess up my takeoff, not get the rotation, and I'll go and land on my head or I'll go and hit the knuckle. But if I do two perfect back sevens landing in the sweet spot and I'm taking the same speed every time, I'm able to go and be like, \"Okay, you don't need to worry about completely botching the takeoff, and you don't need to worry about knuckling the jump, and you don't need to worry about having the right amount of power.\" So, by going and doing the prior tricks and getting them perfect with the two in the row, I'm able to be like, \"Okay, brain, don't worry about that stuff. You have that stuff. Let's go and worry about the things that are unique to this trick.\" And that's really one of the biggest keys to going and getting comfortable with tricks is narrowing it down so you can focus on the unique aspects of each trick. For example, if we're doing like a backside 270 onto a rail, we're going to be like, \"Okay, I need to get a good takeoff so I can get over the rail and rotate so I can land in my board slide.\" So, you need to really think about that takeoff because it's the most important part. Then, if you want to do a back to pullback, there's a little bit more complexity. So, I can't spend my whole time thinking about that takeoff getting over because I need to be thinking about that counter rotation so I can then go and pull it back. So, that's what I'm talking about by like going and simplifying a trick. So, if you're really comfortable with like backside 360s, think about what part of the backside 360s work for you, what parts are easy for you and then what parts you're worried about changing for the five. And then another thing that really helps is making sure that you're just not overdoing it. If you're going and feeling sketchy about your prior tricks before trying the bigger ones, don't try the bigger ones. It's not worth it. Take the time, learn the fundamentals. Build that base because the fear is there to protect you. And working past it is part of being a great snowboarder, part of learning, part of progressing, and why snowboarding is so fun. But sometimes it's there for a good reason. For example, say I'm going to a rail and I want to do a backside boardside. I really want to do a backside boardside on this rail. What parts of this trick are scaring me? Okay, I'm scared that I'm going to land on the rail, slip out, and fall on my back. Very fair concern.",

      "fullText": "in this video we're going to cover 10 of the most common mistakes I see on the mountain the first mistake being just riding too tall and too straight when you're riding really tall and straight it's going to make it so your Center balance is set over the center of your board that gives you no ability to control making it so you're in a passenger mode uh what you want to be doing is adding a little bit of Bend to your legs because that's going to let you go and engage your Edge whenever you're snowboarding you almost never want to be riding flat base because that flat base has no control but as soon as we had a bit of Bend we can get that edge and that's how we can start driving our turns but brings us into number two and that is preemptively setting Edge pressure when you go and do a turn it doesn't work if you just try to go and turn your body off of that flas base especially if you're in a tall position and you try to turn you're going need to rely on something called leaning and leaning is a great way to turn when you're doing stuff like this you can go and be it casual but if you're trying to go and do explosive movement after your body is going to be disconnected and you won't have much power that's why we want to keep that bend in your legs and make sure you set an edge before starting to turn so if I'm doing a tow Edge turn I'm getting on my tow Edge and then I'm driving into it heel Edge driving into it all turns go and work with first getting onto your Edge then adding the power if you try to add to the power flat base it's not going to go and build but brings us into the next issue people have and that's riding to Bent riding to Bent has the same problem of not being able to keep your weight over that edge it also really burns your legs I'll let me Pro okay I'm get in front of me here so when I'm really crouched down I can go and pivot but my natural weight won't be able to be set over my toes or heels so what you want to be doing is a fluid motion where you start a little bit taller get on that edge and push through and it's through this pushing up and down motion that you can get grip get power and really start driving in these turns but you want to make sure you aren't going and leaning forward think of touching your toes if you try to lean forward like you're touching your toes that's not going to put much weight onto your toe Edge because instead it's putting too much weight away from your snowboard so when you're driving your weight down instead of touching your toes think about just squatting down trying to go and keep your point on that centered Edge and channel the energy into that single point every good turn comes from going and staying as locked into that point as you can because if you go and try to move your balance point erratically as you're trying to drive power through it's going to flow it off snowboarding really relies on these smooth clean motions that go and make it so you can go and explode make adjustments and that just isn't possible with leaning another problem people make is riding for hips too open when hips being open has some good benefits you can go and use your hips to go and get more into that edge push through use your body sort of wavy uh if you ride with your hips open all the time it's going to limit you say I'm trying to do an OE it's going to make it so my board wants to rotate and I don't have that clean motion of power so that's why we want our staff position to have our shoulders squared and from here we can go and adjust move out open our hips to engage a turn close our hips and by having this ability to go from neutral to open hips to close hips you'll add a lot more power because we're able to go and Channel Through the energy with every turn so make sure you're not relying on leaning for forward or back when you're trying to get more pressure on that edge and you're not going and trying to push that edge too soon without getting that edge in place you can go and jump straight to that edge but what happens then is you don't have enough speed to make it work so that's why we want this fluent motion one of the biggest issues I see people do is trying to rush all their motions being Rush at Pop being rush into that turn just ere exaggerating your motions and trying to get more power through a IC speed but how you actually get power on your snowboard is FL through fluidity so if we're doing a something like a pop we're going and trying to line it up so everything's connected and in control this will give us more power and keep us just feeling smoother and more controlled if you try to go and get into that turn too soon it's not going to work if you try to go and pop without doing the proper motion it's not going to work so it's really important to go and take your time get onto that edge and continue to load your weight rushing isn't the key to power because every turn relies on building your momentum when I'm first starting a turn I'm turning a lot slower so at this point my turn isn't speeding up at all but as my turn gets deeper it starts to accelerate and that's lets me add more vage to my legs and more power so whenever you're turning think about that it starts slow and as you go and get deep inch of a turn it accelerates you letting you to put more weight onto that edge while staying balanced same with jumping if you just try to jump you're not going to have much power but by channeling the flow through the board you can go and get a controlled pop this brings us into some more freestyle issues the first one I see is people doing something called a two- footer jump that's when you go and jump up just like you would if you weren't on a snowboard this is pushing off both legs at the same time making it so your board leaves off the ground in one motion this isn't a very effective way to get height on a snowboard because it doesn't go and utilize your tail but you still have the downside of needing to carry around this big heavy board what you want to be doing is make TR out your tail is making contact with the snow as long as possible and that's going to give you so much more height then you can ever get with just twoot jumping so like here for this little bump I'm going to make sure to ride off at tail and that's going to help me Coast off get the flex out of the board get the flex of the power so whenever you're thinking about jumping your snowboard don't think about popping with both legs instead think about trying to push your board into the snow make contact with the feature as long as you can letting you go up and pop off off that's the key to getting max power and Max height the smaller the feature the smaller the bump the more it will go and accelerate your height in comparison to getting into just a twoot pop like here I just pop off a tail and you can see maxing out that little side hit with almost no speed what brings me into the next problem I see people have and that is overextending their body when they pop if you go and jump and let your whole torso extend and get tall it's going disconnect your core making it so you don't have any ability to microcontrol your snowboard so what you want to be doing is making sure that you're never going and extending past a little bit of the motion that'll let you go and stay in your stacked tip position we want to leave off the balls of our feet that stacked form it puts a little bit of toe pressure or heel pressure and land in it because that's what lets us get the smooth landing and land clean so you don't want to be landing when you're flat Bas but if you go and pop off and land super extended you're not going to have any ability to make adjustments in the air or get control so when you're jumping think about your core tension and your pop you're doing should never go and fully extend your core muscles instead think about keeping everything engaged tight riding off that tail and that's going to give you that control and lets you land in that confident smooth position oh dude these carving tutorials are no joke and the last common mistake I see is people not planning their turns whenever I'm riding the mountain doing side hits or anything I'm planning each one of my turns where I'm going speed check how much speed do I need so like this feature I need a lot of speed because it's steep so I'm going to charge fast and that's going to let me get up there but then for like more mellow corner here I'm going to make sure to speed check so that way it can focus on getting that turn if you go and don't fully plan what you're doing it's going to be resulting in like for example this coming in too fast the bumps hitting I won't be to hit it smooth and if you try to correct it last second it's going throw you off so like the last second and speed check makes it so I don't have a clean enough Edge to get up here and this is true for carving as well if I'm planning to do a tow Edge carve for certain speeds that work better for it here we have a narrow slope so I'm going to go and time my speed time my pressure and get that turn and go and predict it for where I'm going if I'm going too fast I'm going to preemptively slow down what you see a lot on the mountain is people going and riding and they'll go and start a speed check as we're doing returns so we're combining speed check into each turn toes side turn we're going doing a speed check uh we'll let these guys heelside turn speed check first then turning we don't want to go and combine our speed checks into each one of our turns because it's going to make it so our back tail Wishy washies not let us fully grip on our Edge so whenever you're carving the mountain whenever you're trying to go and do your turns do your tricks make sure that you're thinking ahead planning your speed checks planning where's the best spot to turn where do I want to get low where do I want to pop up and how much speed do I need to do that so for example we have a mogul field here there some Icy patches for some snowy patches I'm going to try do my speed checks in the snowy patches so I can go and stay straight and stacked on my board in the icy patches and control my speed before getting to the feature so I can ride off in that stack position keeping my weight set being good at snowboarding means you're good at shifting between these balance points connecting your energy and you can't do that if you're not planning ahead or you're setting yourself up for failure so let's drop in here and we have a little bump here so I'm going to preemptively slow down on at ice we're going pop up I see another bump so I'm going slow down do another slow down so I can pop and then I'm going straight bomb that little bit of bumpy flat light because I don't want to be Edge for that for here we got a ridiculously icy section so I'm going to look around for soft snow I see a patch of soft snow here slow down I see a s patch snow over here use that to slow down using these little bits of terrain to plan my turns my cares would just make it so I can go and stay in control and stay smooth across the whole mountain and that is 10 common mistakes I see all the time of the mountain fix these mistakes in your riding even if it's just a couple of them and it'll make you such a better snowboarder

But for now, we just need to focus on that technique. And the first technique we need to get dialed is back to that stack position. Just like how we are rotating over at head spot the whole way, that's a position that lets us utilize counter rotation. If we're too tall and too straight, we try to pop up and use counter rotation, it's going to be very limited. This is only possible with that slight hinge in the hips and keeping your head over that same point. A good way to train this before going for the full 360 is with a little 90 progression. So instead of trying to go and jump and do a full 360, I want you to go and jump into a 90 and then use counter rotation pull through.",

      "fullText": "This makes it so I can go and get onto the rail with very minimal movement. And see how my upper body is hardly changing in angle at all. And then since I'm landing in this strong angle that's the same angle I want to take off, jump in, it's really easy to then go and channel that momentum through. Channeling all the way. And you can see the arms are slowly continuing that rotation. So then when I pop off, exactly the same thing. angle in the upper body, weight shifted to that back foot, sliding off and getting that clean exit. And then this is a switchboard. Same way, and it's basically exactly the same trick, just a little bit broken up. So, a big issue people have when they're doing their board slides is they're coming up and they'll really go and pop with their body, but all you really need to do is maintain that tail pressure. So, look at how my board's just maintaining that tail pressure. super exaggerated hinge in the upper body. That's because my upper body is preempty in the position. It wants to be on the rail. See how stable that movement is. That's what lets me go and get this clean transition of power. And you can see on a trick like this, you don't really need to be rushing into that rotation. You have plenty of time to go and start generating it because to get those around, you can utilize a lot of counter rotation, making them more important to just get on the rail in a strong position. And that's something I'm really going to pay attention to this year is unlocking more strong positions for myself on the rail. So more on my front foot. And I really want to open up some like front board same ways more consistently, that kind of stuff. Coming back to this backside 360. And while this by itself is a really fantastic trick, we're still seeing some problems. And the main one being look at this setup carve. Same problem. board taking massive angle towards the side, making it so my upper body is holding this V position. This makes it so as I transition to my toe edge, I'm doing a really big turn radius and I'm actually letting my board go flat base for a second. So, see how it's not like clean edge to edge. And that's why when I'm getting onto my tow edge, I'm sort of in this position here where even though my upper body is open, my board's angled already towards the center of the jump. So, this position is really hard to get your hips open and your chest open and keeping your board sort of angled here. And that's really what you want on every single backside spin is to have your board angled towards that like right corner if you're regular footed towards that left corner because it really will open up the range of motion in your hips. So, I'm not doing that here and that's why I'm going and getting this little bit of scrub off the takeoff. Not as clean as could be. What I am doing a really good job of on openness backside 360 is not over snapping. That's a big misconception people have on backside 360 that you want to be throwing it like a serious spin, but really they don't take much energy and you want to be leaving in a pretty neutral position with this range of motion of the hips. So that way you can go and channel your momentum through. See how my upper body is now channeling. Uh this is a big jump but it's true on smaller jumps as well.",

Not a big deal because I'm hitting this most core principle and that is flowing my energy through the spin. Making sure to not over snap it. So then I can go and keep that upper body momentum going after the spin, pulling with that back arm, letting the head follow, and that's letting me go and finish it off with counter rotation.

      "fullText": "we're going to break down your backside 360 off a rail takeoff to see how you can get it better smoother and make it less of a Huck first things first this is not an ideal rail takeoff to be doing it on you want a nice long flat rail takeoff with a good landing and not much kick that's the best platform to do this trick off a short takeoff that's super kicky up is going to be really challenging because it's just going to Buck you and not give you a good platform to lock your Edge and generate your spin Plus you're going to have this rail here making it so you need to drift every time and on top of that a narrow takeoff means that you'll be actually hurting the takeoff for people that are trying to ride the rail so if you're going to use a rail takeoff as a training tool I'd highly recommend finding a long flat one that has a good Landing because it's going to make it a lot easier now breaking down the mechanics of a trick the first thing we want to look at is how long you spending on your toes you're spending a very long duration on your toe Edge and this is making it really hard for you to hold this tall posture so you can see how you're nice and Tall here that looks great but because you're holding the tow Edge for so long you start leaning leaning leaning making it so you're leaving off in a very bent down brok an the waist position you're keeping relatively stacked what's good uh you're not letting yourself round in the spine that said you don't want to be leaning down this much and extending because of a couple reasons we'll get into but to fix this all you need to do is increase how long you're doing heel Edge pressure decrease how long you're doing toe Edge pressure that just makes it a lot easier don't look at my heal Edge setup carve here it's pretty trash but look at how short of a period of time I'm spending on my toes I'm getting onto my toes as I start winding up because that's going to make it so I don't need to hold this tall position longer than necessary this is the hardest position you're going to have to hold so the less time you need to hold it the better now when we go and actually break down the trick there's a couple things we can notice here first of all because you're going and starting with this bent down position it's making it so when you go and snap your Spin and rotate through because you were lean forward it makes it so your rotation goes up and around instead of being flat and letting yourself stay stacked in that straight line and this is a really big deal because it makes it so you can't go and properly lead the rotation with your upper body so if we go and compare these takeoffs we can see that you're leaned for forward where I'm trying to stay stacked over my board and lean rotation with my head down but because you're so leaned over it makes it so when you try to lead and spot rotation your head goes up and around but brings us into the next problem you're spotting over your shoulder you want all of your spots to be set underneath your arm so that way you can go on spot The Landing sooner and you can control the rotation a backside 360 off a little jump doesn't need to be a big committed motion as long as as you lead the rotation of your upper body you can use counter rotation to go and finish the spin so that's what you're missing here you're basically trying to make this trick a lot harder than it needs to be by getting your toes too soon making a balancing act then you're trying to snap it really hard and the reason why you need to snap it so hard here is because you're not able to leave the rotation of your upper body effectively if your vist leaned over because it's going to make your head go up and around your shoulder so if you try to lead up your upper body what would it do it would go and make you face plant so there's a couple things you need to change here so first you need to go and spend less time on the toes stay more stacked and tall and that will give you a better platform to generate the spin this will be easier on a flatter takeoff next you need to make sure that you're not going and over popping your body see how you're going and extending so much with the body here this is too big of a motion and it's making it so you're using all your energy to go up instead of your energy to go around a backside 360 will work better if you keep this popping your legs a lot smaller so this is about the maximum pop I'd ever have in my legs on a backside 360 and we can see that it's still significantly less than you're using that's because this is the power Zone more than this and it's not going to be a controlled uh range of motion that you can actually generate the spin from the next thing we need to change here is you need need to make sure you're not dropping this shoulder right here into the ground because that's going to make it so your whole rotation is set upwards and when your rotation set upwards it's going to set your head to go look over the shoulder what elongates your body extending everything making it harder to control and that's why we're seeing this arm get brought up blocking you off a proper backside 360 has a nice tall posture popping up leading the rotation of that upper body pulling with that back arm across keeping that chest forward and then you go and pull with that back arm through a full duration of the spin until you need to use counter rotation to bring it back around so if I had more air time here I would have kept my upper body leading rotation the whole time here I use counter rotation to get the feet around but that's only possible if this chest is leading the rotation so all you need to do is less time on the tow Edge taller on the takeoff make sure that you're not throwing down into the ground make sure that you're leading with your upper body well this is very important keeping that spot underneath the arm pulling with that back arm throughout the rotation and then using counter rotation if needed from there make those changes and it should make the backside 360 a lot easier a lot less scary and a lot more approachable also find a different feature to do it off that feature is putting this trick into hard mode so make those changes let me know how it goes backside free 60s are very tricky because they're one of the most important fundamental tricks and they are building blocks so you're learning a lot and a lot of principles all at once when trying this trick so try to make these changes and let me know when you're ready for the next steps",

He's not doing anything like ridiculously unheard of, but he's doing it with enough bend and enough uh responsibility that when he goes and feels the snow try take him someplace, he's going and falling and linking it. I have no doubt he was still planning to do this line, but the way he gets there, uh, very creative, very cool, and it's all done be from keeping this ridiculously exaggerated upper body hinge. And it's just such a powerful position that he uses probably better than anyone. And this turn here is so sick. Just coming up, railing it. Notice how that his weight is over his toe edge. And then to get onto the heel edge, all he does is shift his weight more towards that back foot. Super subtle motion, letting him get super low and controlled without relying on leaning.

      "fullText": "hey shreders Tavis here from the beautiful suburbs of Edmonton today I'm going to teach you every single thing I know about backside wind ups and snaps and we're doing it shirtless not just for two female viewers but also because there's a lot of micro movements and adjustments that you can't see necessarily of clothes on we'll be covering in this video it's going to be very in depth because backslide takeoffs are some of the most complex aspects of all snowboarding triking and it's a building block of all of your bside spins so we're going to start with a base six and then get into a nitty-gritty starting with what you want to be doing what you want to be doing every single time you do a backside spin is holding light toe pressure opening up your hips having your chest rotate as your arms come out in a nice level line we don't want to be having any dip any crunch because that's going to make it if you snap your spin it's going to continue that access so watch this even here even if I have the perfect Point position if I go and let my shoulder drop just a little bit and start to fro it's going to round out my whole spin rotation making it so my shoulder gets dropped down same with being too far up to should heels that's going to make it to my rotation is sent up throwing me off AIS so it's a really fine line so what we're trying to achieve with our snap is parallel shoulders but set our head into a nice position to be underneath our arm we don't want to be snapping up and over the arm across to down because that's going to throw you off access and make it hard to control now we're going to talk about about a little bit of the nitty-gritty details before going in and talking about how they all come together in order to make a perfect backside takeoff so let's start with the feet and work our way up leg positioning so one thing you might see people do is lift her front foot as for toes dig in this is really hard to do in an actual snowboard so instead of actually trying to do this it's more of a general Vibe the reason why this is the vibe is because it goes sets your weight with your back knee onto your toe it helps you grip in holding a clean line and then lifting the heel helps you open your hips will shifting weight back onto your heel Edge making sure that you don't start tipping forward and digging in and that's what lets you build up that strong hip opening clock for and what we're aiming for here is a knee that's going straight past our big toe we don't want this knee to come in come out because that's a compromised position that's going to be hard to Spring from just think of trying to ride through a jump SPO like this is going Buckle so we want it to be in that strong stack position as we rotate the hips it takes a while to build this range of motion and for something like a back three or a back five it doesn't need to be too exaggerated but the reason why we're opening the hits is to fold first it lets us take our chest and open it more towards the takeoff so when we snap our spin we have more range of motion to use before being fully closed off to the lip of the jump and the next reason we're opening up is just because it's going to give you more power and more room to drive so you want to open up a little bit for these smaller spins but you don't need this full exaggeration maximum oage for the smaller tricks build up to it because it does take time next let's talk a little bit more about these hips and the bend on our legs we don't want to be coming into jump super bent down because that's going to go and put more pressure on the edge and it's just going to be harder to control your strongest range of motion for jumping is right here this little bit of Pop we're not trying to do full down and jumps especially on spins so you only want a very slight Bend in your legs and that slight Bend will give you just enough room to go extend off your tail now let's talk a little bit about core breaking the waist because this is where most people start to mess up so the reason why I have no shirt here is because we need to demonstrate breaking at the waist breaking up the waist is when you're up upper body leans forward not in correlation to your glutes so that's why you can see people go and squat down more get lower as long as you keep your chest over top of your knees that's going to keep your Center balance on your board letting you use that full range of motion up and down but as soon as you go and let your upper body hinge forward not in correlation to your legs coming back it's going set your weight forward and the biggest thing you're going to see happen is people get onto her toes too aggressively and start to lean forward lean forward and that's going make them start breaking at the waist so in order to avoid this it's going to be a lot of an approach issue as well so we'll talk about it in a sec but you need to make sure that you're not going and letting yourself hinge forward break forward let that spine round as soon as your spine does anything but hold that straight Arc is going to be not ideal we'll demonstrate this in the bags quick so watch this I can squat down through this whole motion while maintaining a squat position because I'm letting my butt come out in correlation to my upper body going forward but as soon as I let my upper body hinge and start going down it's going to make it so first I'm feeling a lot of straight in my lower back second it's letting me fall over I need you to activate it your squat down motion shouldn't be going and making you lean forward or lean backwards it should be set on your balls of your feet and as you go down it continues to go down with you maintaining that same contact Point that's going to be really important important next we'll talk about head positioning and arm positioning before talking about how we can bring this all together uh how are you doing you comfy mom I got my mom feeling this pretty dope uh all right so arm positioning uh you want your arms to be thrown on this nice parallel plane of rotation if you're trying to Cork you go and shift it more over your tail shifting your whole upper body instead of your shoulders or starting to like try throw down you want your whole body to be shifted into whatever rotation you're trying to do the issue what happens here is a lot of times people will go and let their shoulders start caving in so you can see that I can try throw a spin by having my shoulder push forward this is an ideal we want our shoulders to be squared think of it as you have a steel bar coming all the way through of them and you're throwing them connected so when I go and throw a bside spin my shoulders are staying straight and in line instead of coming and crumpling the reason why we don't want this crumple is because the front B drops your shoulder and when you start dropping your shoulder starts bending you forward breaking up a waist making so your throw goes down little go and put you on an access Cho down and over it's going to be a lot harder to control that's why I have a straight strong shoulders your shoulders should always be in the stiff line and if you want to add more cork more AIS you start taking this line and angling it all together so I'm throwing flat spin cork super cork work Misty so if I'm doing like a super flippy dub back 10 I'd be winding up shifting my whole body up and over my tail like that trying to keep a straight line straight shoulders everything strong and head positioning if you don't have a right head positioning it's going to mess everything up so there's two things you need to make sure you're doing with your head first of all looking as close to the takeoff as you can you don't want to be looking at the center of a takeoff you want to be looking at where your board's coming off the take off this is something I still struggle with and I'm working on because it's not easy and then the next part was going to determine your access rotation how well you can spot is making sure that your head is leading the rotation coming in right under the shoulder without overextending if you let your neck start coming down start twisting overextending it's the same principles as the Torso and everything you want to keep it tight with just using your chin to tilt it down leaving in this stack position where your head's leading but you're not going in stretching it extending it instead it's just a nice little subtle position now how do we bring that all together well first of all you can't do a wind up without a approach so the best way to think about doing this approach is not leaning to your heels but leaning to your toes because when you're leaning to your toes it's going to make it your momentum rolls you forward when you want to collapse out the waist start turning off the end so instead it should be squatting down extra to get your weight shifted on your heels just by putting pressure down on it and that makes it so it's easy to swap and transition to your toe Edge in this light motion well open at the hips so that's a goal of every approach you have to be coming in suddenly heels slightly angled towards the corner of a takeoff and then shift from that suddenly to open your hips so we're not going heel Edge toe Edge wind up instead we're trying to have our weight shift on your heels and as we go and add that rotation to the toes it goes and moves the pressure from being heel focused toes dug in hips open and this is naturally going to go and put pressure onto our tow Edge allowing us to get on our toe edge with a lot less sideways momentum making it so you can hold a straight line a lot longer I guess the last thing we'll talk about here is timing how you can piece it all together your timing and wind up for the backside spins really important this position is really hard to hold you don't want to be riding into a jump like this because you're going to get bucked you're going to start digging in so you want to go and make sure that you're not going and doing your wind up until you go heels toes and as you're going for your toes then you open up and then for your snap it's really important to not overd it if you're doing a 360 just a light shoulder close will be more than enough to be able to get most of this rotation around by making sure that you're leaving stacked leading up your upper body this is because you can use something called counter rotation it's slippy right here so I won't push it but instead of trying to throw everything together keeping everything tight you can go and let your upper body lead a little bit then finish it with your legs this is the mindset you should be taking into every backside snap letting your upper body set for rotation lead it and continue leading it through the spin as you tighten stuff together so if you do a seven you're not trying to go snap here keeps everything tight for a full duration instead you're trying to go snap let your upper body leave a rotation and then as the rotation continues you slowly bring things together well making sure that your upper body's pulling leading into that rotation and that's how you can get a smooth rotation but you don't need to worry about much power so it's your recap try to get light heel pressure by going and squatting down shifting your hips open to help you shift onto your toe Edge winding up no more than necessary you want to have as small Lin up as needed this should only be X Games mode and then the last thing is making sure that you have a nice smooth release not trying to go and rush for timing smoothness and precision is really important if you can get a smooth straight line off a takeoff smooth constant speed of snap with your upper body is going to set you up for a powerful spin I actually have one more thing to talk about because uh I don't have a structure or anything but your arm positioning you don't need to have your arms off Thug mode the whole time seep from straight uh a lot of Pros keep their arm down but as they grow or spin they let their arm come up and this does a lot to like extend body make it tighter so it looks like this my big problem and I'll be honest about this here is I don't bring my arm up high enough it has to do with shoulder tears bad form so I do my spins a lot like this where I'm keeping my shoulders flat and stacked but because my arm's not fully up it's not giving me complete control over my rotation it's not having my arms help me give that rotation instead of spinning a little bit through the jump so that's something I'm personally working on is making sure that my arm is finishing rotation flat because at the end of the day if you get a straight takeoff you go and get a nice pop of a flat body with a proper head position your backside spin will just work so it's a very complex motion there's a bunch of little details that can go and throw you off and it's really hard to go and fix one of these problems without another one showing its bang so go practice this form at home just practice opening up your hits getting used to this range of motion shifting your weight snapping practicing this at home practicing it when you're going down the mountain is one of the best things you can ever do for your riding so stay training on it and when when you go to actually bring it to snow it should be a lot easier and we'll go and make more videos on this with actual snowboarding but this is what I do I spend a lot of time looking the mirror working on my wind ups my Snaps and honestly if you want to do backside spins I really think you should try as well I'm Tavis from Stone War explained and thank you for watching the video I hope you learn something new",

Instead of going straight and then trying to turn into it, I'm preemptively setting my whole body on the angle of the takeoff. So, my board's angled towards the takeoff, my hips angled towards the takeoff, my upper body's angled towards the takeoff. This is making it so it's like I'm riding just straight downhill even though it's off the track. And this is minimizing the motions because we want to maintain a pretty flat base position. You obviously need a bit of toe edge to go and turn up here and grip into the snow, but we don't want to actually be getting on that edge and riding it because that's going to be a harder position to generate power from. And if we look at the takeoff, you can see that I'm leaving relatively flat base and I'm keeping myself as centered over my board as I can. And this is actually a cool little thing is you can have a little bit of toe pressure, but as you go and extend your legs, it's going to make it so you're less hunched over because now your body's taller. And when you do this, you want to lessen the pressure on the base of your snowboard. So even if you have a lot of toe edge coming into the feature because you need it to hit the feature, as you go and extend and pop up, we want to lessen that toe edge to take off as flat base as possible.",

Anyway, disc golf is just my sport of choice, but like tennis, basketball, surfing, they all are built around the same stack position and the same movement principles. So, practicing and partaking in any of them during the summer is going to really help improve your snowboarding. And if you ever see kids and you're like, \"That's an athletic kid.\" Usually the athletic kids are made from doing so many different sports that they get good at moving their bodies in these ways. It's natural to move in an athletic stance, but you need to practice it. So, I suggest that you get out there, practice your own sports, think about your stack position, think about your movements and timing because it will translate to snowboarding. And if you want to take my advice, I'd highly recommend getting a disc and trying the disc golf field out because it's one of my favorite activities. It's so good for training these movements, watching it fly, and the mental clarity is so good. And I must say, it's a pretty good cardio workout, too. So, get out there, shred the mountain, shred the slopes, and hopefully we'll see you on the fall course sometime. Have a good one and thanks for watching.",

This is making it so my weight is centered, but my rotation points going to be that over that tail. And it'll also make it so as I pop up naturally, I'm leaving off the tail of my snowboard. Comparing that to this clip, we can see that his upper body is completely set over his front foot. This is going to make it so as he goes and tries to get that rotation, he's now rotating over that front foot as the access point. And not only that, it's making it so he can't leave off the tail. And we can see the tail is actually the first part that leaves and the nose is down. This is making it so he's not utilizing the lip of the feature.

      "fullText": "yo let's go and break down your straight airs to see why you're not feeling comfortable and what we can do to get you to a point you're comfortable so you can start bringing at your larger jumps and just feeling more like a boss on your snowboard a good straight air is really necessary for just building The Vibes and building the energy so you got a couple Clips let's watch through of them see what we can notice yeah so uh we're not going bother breaking down this first one because we can't see the takeoff and the takeoff is what we need to go and look at for a straight air it's all decided off the takeoff baby so your problem here is uh quite simple you're going and rounding at the B spine and taking off with your legs bent making this little question mark shape we'll call this the question mark mistake uh basically you're going and letting your spine round and then you're having your legs bent these are two serious problems because we're going to do two things we're going to go and lessen the amount of Pop you're getting off the Jump and we're also going to go and throw you off balance so that's why when we go and watch the clip we'll see that you're going and you're not getting any air up you're not going up with a jump you're going through the jump and then you're needing to use your body to go and rebalance yourself so this is happening for a couple reasons mainly when you're hunched over like this it's going to be putting pressure over your toe edge here you did a pretty good job at being flat but you're fighting for it like even if you don't think you're fighting for it in this position in order to keep flat base you're going need to do some serious counterbalance this would be okay if you winding up to go and fully pop the problem is here you're not extended so it's quite simple The Fix You need to make here but that doesn't mean it's easy uh your riding position we basically need to get it so this position here where you're nice and Tall over balls your feet a little bit of toe pressure uh you could even go and have that a little bit more straighter but you're basically trying to take that position and have it so you're using it right here you should be ah let me go back a single frame you should be in that fully extended position right here as your tail snaps off the lip because what bat's going to do is it's going to go and let you go push off and get up with the jump it's going to put you on that Arc that will go and put you down into that Landing all nice instead of right now you're absorbing the takeoff through your spine and through your legs and that's why you're going through the jump and why you're not feeling comfortable you're not going to feel comfortable if you absorb the jump because it's not going to give you that pop and air time because you're spending the whole time G going and traveling across the knuckle hitting the knuckle never really getting that floater so even though you're hitting a bigger jump you're not getting that air and that's all because of this Bend this question mark body position so uh what you need to do is instead of as you're going up for jump curling up getting bent down into his question mark position you need to be pushing out getting your legs extended straight tall this doesn't mean you should actively pop this just means means you can't be going into the jump and letting the jump break you because right now you're just going in and you're getting nervous so you're bending down losing confidence breaking up the waste and absorbing the takeoff this is just a textbook absorption of the takeoff what's a very common mistake but it's one we're going to try to get you to fix and avoid so we got one more jump here let's go and see uh if what you're doing is similar I'm assuming it's going to be relatively similar because that seems like you are very comfortable with that kind of position yeah so this one bigger jump bigger jump not quite as noticeable it's not quite as exaggerated but we're still seeing the same things you're coming off a jump in ah my line you're coming off a jump in that question mark position and that's losing you power and here we can even see a little bit of open chest so see how your back arm is sort of like in front here with this this means your hips are opening a little bit which also another thing that's going thrill you off in the air so we don't really need to go in Deep dive this one you did it a little bit better here uh that's because you weren't quite as bent down but we can really see it here watch right there see how you dip down right as you go off the lip that means you're going and border crossing the jump means absorbing the takeoff you're going from a more extended position and been crouching up boom right there I can't slow-mo it but just one more time see how your legs just crumple up okay one more time that's basically your whole issue here too much bending the legs and then you're going and increasing that bend as you ride off the lip so I'm just going to go make myself big for a second and just demonstrate more what you should be doing right now you're coming in you're tall you're in a stack position but as you go up a jump you're going more and more and as you go to the off the jump your then going and absorbing it what this does do is it goes and makes it so you're going and pulling up with the lip knocking that push off it you don't need to actively bend down and jump off to get air but you do need to make sure that you're not going and bending down when leaving off the lip because that's going to absorb it so if you bend down you need to then push up or you can do the other technique called the coast which a good way to get comfortable with jumps and as just holding that strong position where balls your feet and then not moving it this position holding this exactly here stationary strong would give you way more air time than what you're doing right now because with this when I go off the Jump I'm going to go hit the up hit the kick and stay strong what's going to send me up with it and then if I want to get more power fat then I add a little more bench to my legs and as I'm going off the Jump I then extend extending leaving off my back foot not so much about you're like getting a tail press but just enough about your weight shifted so you can get pressure on your tail the whole time and that little bit of motion that little bit of Pop literally just from here to here is all you need to get maximum air time so if you're trying to get more air on the jump you need to go less Bend in the body you should you don't want to be Arc in your spine you can have a little bit of Bend in your back but that's only from counteracting your bum you never want to round it we're never trying to make that question mark right so there's a big difference between this and this this I'm counterbalancing by sticking my butt out putting my chest forward but I'm still stacked and strong so when I come into a jump it looks like this instead of like this so why we're doing that is because that lets us keep our weight set where as soon as you hunch over it sets your weight forward and when you need to spend time fighting that because it's going to make you want to dig in your tow Edge so to go stay strong straight-legged little bit of Bend hold this position for a coast off but when you want to get pop you go down just a little bit more and then extend timing it so your tail leaves off the end you're just going and squatting down so go straighten it up focus on staying strong and staffed and that's going to make these straight airs and jumps feel way more comfortable let me know once you've applied these tips or if you need any more

So I'm actually making sure to under rotate slightly be dig in my heels to absorb that little bit of rotational energy coming into the landing. Because even with this impact, notice how my board wants to keep spinning throughout that landing and it keeps shifting. So ideally, we're rotating these tricks early enough so that way we can use counter rotation to slow down. But when you need to go and speed up the rotation throughout the full duration, we're going to need to under rotate slightly because if I landed with my board completely rotated here, that little bit of slip out would have caused me to slip towards my toe edge and that' make it so I didn't land the trick. So here I'm purposely under rotating and jamming my heels in to kill that rotational energy. And the really cool thing about these landing mechanics is they're basically exactly the same as proper jumping mechanics. The only difference is instead of loading up to explode and generate power using the same principles to go and slow down, elongate your motions and absorb that energy. It's also exactly how you want to be landing in powder. here. If it was deeper snow, I'd just have my hips slightly more tilted up, upper body more pulled forward, and that way I could land tail heavy. Because it's not very deep, I can go and use my hip shift to go and pull my board down and only land a little bit tail heavy. The only thing that really stops this technique from working is over elongation. If we lose that hinge in our hips, we're going to go and slip out towards our heels. Here, it's happening for a few reasons.",

been like 4 days my right ankles toast my knees mess whole body hurts uh but honestly got away with it pretty good so we're going to break it down see why this happened and what we can do to avoid in the future because this is a trick I got on lock I've done it for years now hundreds of times off of dozens of different jumps but this one just did not work but that's for a reason every trick doesn't work for a reason so this is one that did work and we're going to see the principles nice full extension pulling in getting the grab and this is the part that's most important for a duback 10 pulling in over over the shoulder with your eyes locked on the knuckle this is what lets you spot the trick and get control of it and then the next part is you can see how consequential this trick is look at my head's like three feet away from the knuckle as I'm pulling to the next flip you clip that you're having a bad time so this trick is always Plain on the edge of like what's safe versus what's not safe but this is the part that we really want to focus on is right here my rotation is set and I have enough air time so I can utilize counter rotation to finish with spin because that's going to be the thing that we're really missing on this attempt you can see I go and get a decent snap pretty straight decently extended hit the grab at the same time pull on the shoulder but there's one thing here that's very different and that's the kick of the jump this jump didn't have much kick on it so when I threw the dub back 10 it didn't throw me up nearly as flippy as I expected this makes it so I had to pull into a flip more at 650 and V makes it so you're pull more downwards instead of an upward feeling not letting you go and pull in and generate rotation and that's making it so when I come around I can see the ground and I see I don't have the power and I don't have a rotation making it so my only course of action is landing on the face and this is why this trick is so devastating sometimes because you clip your nose you can hit your knee uh you boys can just walk through uh this is Harry and Josh snowboard addiction members uh so yeah let's break down why this happened because it wasn't for form I've done this trick before I know my form is great instead it was because of my ideas and my planning I just thought if I did my normal dub back 10 set of motions it would just come out and work and I just land and get a sick clip but I didn't take into factors the conditions the main conditions I didn't take into play was how small this jump actually is this Jump's like a 20ft jump gives you 1.5 seconds of air time and how how little kick it has this jump doesn't have much ump that's kicks referring to let froze you up last second it had a good amount of kick in the morning when it was icy but it was around 30 minutes from my last hit on this jump versus the DU acted head and in that time it slushed up just enough so I went and pushed through the jump instead of getting that little bit of resistance and that made it so my rotation was less flippy than anticipated so I couldn't go and generate rotation but that's what happened what could we do to avoid this mistake because it was very avoidable there's two things we could have avoided first of all properly planning it didn't even pop into my head that this was a possibility to slam on this trick the second thing would be throwing it more flippy because the jump didn't have much kick and it didn't have much air time I should have prioritized getting both the flips out of the way because if I went and through it more down like a misty I would have been been able to throw up and pull into it so even then if I underrot rotated I'd only be under rotating the spin factor and not the flip Factor because if you under rotate the flip on a double that means you're going to go and land on your face where if you're under roting him a spin it's still not ideal you risk like Edge catching a lot of impact uh but it's not as costly I didn't really think about this because my hips injured so I'm like well I need to land it because if I go and mess at the Landing it's going to really hurt my hip what brings us into another thing that you probably shouldn't be doing you shouldn't be doing your biggest trick off the the smallest jump uh when you're not 100% I've done this trick a lot when I wasn't 100% but off smaller features because you can see it's literally only like2 seconds that's the difference of me stomping this St back 10 versus slamming so what can you learn from this to incorporate in your own writing when hitting a feature it's really important to take in all the considerations so that means understanding how kicky of a jump is how much air time you're getting off a jump how the Steep The Landing is that means how much impact you're getting on the landing and how close you are to the ground is the jump sending you up is it sending you long is it sending you low all these things will really affect your rotation and how the Trick's done for example a kicky jump will go and make it so if you're doing a cork it will naturally throw you into it more meaning that you won't need to prioritize a flip as much where a flatter jump like fist isn't doing much to Thrill you so that means you're going need to generate more of that rotation that flip yourself the next thing we need to take and factor is what time of year is it and how are the conditions changing did it snow so that's like some of the things that can change how the jumps riding did it snow so it's fresher groomed this makes it so the jump gets chewed up faster making it so you can dig in and it's softer making the jump less icy less strong the icier the jump is the more powerful it will be but when it's slushy like fist that means it's going to get gradually softer as the day goes on so now let's go and point out just what I could have done differently in this situation so you can really see it right here I popped and I actually knew right here something didn't feel right I didn't feel that power that that you need to get the double round and that's was confirmed once I pulled into the second flip here that's when I saw the ground and that's when you can see I let go of a grab and my arms came up and I sort of was in shock here surprised shocked and just taken in so if I was going to go and do this again I honestly want have changed anything about rotation my rotation my snap everything looked great I just needed to minimize the risk and we would have done that by going and taking into consideration how the jump was going to fry me so adding more flip making the rotation come around faster so that's just something I want you to take into your own writing don't only think about the trick think about the feat you're doing it on think about how much air time you have how it feels and your tricks prior to it because I was just doing back sevens to warm up for this and normally I do back sevens and I try to get them over my toes and dominated so I feel like I'm really in control but here for this du back 10 I was just doing them SL TBA heels and expected i' get that more power when I actually went for the biggest trick so what I learned from this is to go and really think about how it jumps riding how the slush conditions will change and to make sure that I really get comfortable putting more power I skipped a step because I didn't want to make my hip injury worse and now I'm paying for it so that's what what I want you to keep in mind go figure out the jump figure out not only the trick you're doing but every other factor that goes in because every Fall's avoidable and most Falls happen because of a failure to plan so take your time planning out the trick if you want to get a double it's very doable but figure out the best way to do it to minimize your own personal risk hopefully I won't have any more slams to share but this was a pretty big fall it's my first time ever hitting my face and like I said I'm like out for a week what could be a lot worse so around 7 days recovery for a slam like fist but you could get unlucky hit your shoulder a little bit more hit your knee Twisted in a weird way so you're just trying to minimize these situations as much as you possibly can so that's my biggest slam ever uh first time ever hitting with face so I hope you learned something from it and hopefully it will help you avoid being in a similar situation in the future thanks for joining me today and have a good one",

      "fullText": "Picking the right pair of boots is one of the most important things you can do as a snowboarder to the extent where if you pick the wrong pair of boots, it can affect your whole season. One time I was riding the wrong boots and it gave me a bone spur that made it so I actually couldn't ride for multiple weeks at a time and it actively made it one of the most painful years of my life. So fitting and picking the perfect pair of boots is one of the most important things you can do. And in this video, I'm going to walk you through everything I learned about picking boots over the last 18 years. And I've learned a lot of cool tricks and techniques for selecting the perfect pair because I got some wonky looking feet. And yeah, we're going to break this video down into five parts and that will make it easier for a specific section because we're going to be covering a lot of information, giving you everything you need in order to go and make the boot choice that'll let you ride all day with no pain. So, let's get right into it. First thing you want to do when picking a pair of boots is make sure that you have a general sense of the size of your foot. Every boot fitting shop will have these tools. And usually there's also boot fitters that will help you do it. And a really important thing to note for this is every board company's boots are going to fit slightly differently. So here I'm measuring at a 8.5. It's also really important to measure the other foot because you can have two different size feet. 8.5 here. That doesn't necessarily mean that I'll be using an 8.5 boot. For example, I ordered a pair of 32s at 8.5 and they were far too short to the extent that riding them caused me permanent nail damage and I just could not punch in the toes. So, that's why we're going to go really in depth into the fitting and how they should feel for length and width. Cuz that's the other part about snowboard boots is the width of your foot. And you can see that you can measure it. And the most important thing for this is each boot model is coming in a different width. And some boots actually come in a wide form and just a normal form. I have really wide feet. So you can see that my feet at the balls of the feet really come and spread out here. This means I'm going to need a really wide shoe. And this really narrows down the amount of boots that I'll be able to get. So you really want to be mindful when you're picking your boots. Is your foot wider? Is your foot more narrow? Uh generally if you have issues with just putting on normal shoes, it feels tight. you probably have a bit of a wider foot where if you can just buy like any pair of Nikes off the shelves and they feel great uh whip rise then your foot's probably more on the normal side because every brand fits so differently it's really important to not be brand loyal or just buy a boots without trying it on anything like reviews it all depends on your personal experience and how that boot fits specifically for your foot because it's not just about size here let's go and find a boot to go and try we will try on this DC 9.5. So, a full size larger than what I normally ride. And this is just going to help me go and tell you what to look for for too large of a boot. So, whenever you're trying on a boot, it's important to do the full tightening process. I have skinny calves, so I always need to do this part extra tight.",

      "fullText": "This is a stack position. All the way down to here, I'm still maintaining a stack position. And this also is true for opening the hips. I can go and maintain the same center of balance with opening my hips, dropping down, and shifting all within it. Basically, every single movement and every single thing you do, you want to try and maintain your balance over the same point. And that's how you go and get power and control in snowboarding. I'll go and give you a little freestyle example here. If I'm doing something like a front side 180 and I pop off flat base, it's going to make it so as I rotate, I'm going to land very heel heavy and risk falling. but by just by maintaining my weight over my balls of my feet, I go and rotate through and I land back on the balls of my feet. So, every time you go and do a turn or anything like that, you're trying to move within a range of motion that lets you keep that center of balance. Obviously, if you switch your heel edge, you'll need to go and switch your weight to your heels slightly, but we're still trying to keep that weight set over top of a board. So, in this video, we're just going to walk through how you can go and get comfortable with this motion, find it, and how you can go and reach the limits of what it can do for you. And that's going to let you go and perform way better maneuvers on your snowboard. So, first thing I want you to do is find your neutral stack position. It always needs to have a little bit of bend in your legs. If your legs are completely straight, your weight's going to be set balanced over top of your feet. So, straight feet, no go. Bend down. Feel how she goes. And try to add enough bend that you're feeling that balance point. You don't want to have too much bend to hit this point because we're not going to be able to ride all day like this. It's going to be too intense of a motion. So, the base of your stack position should be the bare minimum bend in your body in order to have this balance on the balls of your feet. The next thing that's really important is you need to make sure that your upper body comes down in correlation to the bend in your legs.",

      "fullText": "You physically can't get enough extension here. And as you go and over snap and over rotate it, your rotation is now set upwards. And this makes it so beneficial because now as you're spinning the spin at 650 here, you're set into an upward rotation. So you can pull in where with Mark style, the downward motion the OG way at this point, if you tried to go and tuck in, you'd be set downwards. And that's why when we see Mark finishing this trick, he's finishing the 14, then doing a late 180 utilizing counter rotation where these guys can just continue the rotation. Here he's doing it pretty flippy, but still watch his head and watch how he can instantly rotates on the same axis. Comes up, snaps, overextends the upper body, pushes through the hips, head right here, stationary. And now watch the spot coming through. And it's basically in the exact same spot the whole way. He's rotating around his front foot as the axis point and not pulling his head and is able to continue that motion the whole time. And that's why backside spins have been completely revolutionized and we're going to see them continue to grow. And I highly recommend going and watching the pros, seeing them on Instagram, and next time you see X Games, see if you can spot if the snowboarder is throwing in the OG way, throwing down over their tail, or if they're over snapping that spin and using the new style to hit that constant cork and that constant spot. because you're going to see some guys still doing it the old way, but the more the sport progresses and the more things continue to change, if you want to stay competitive, you'll have to go adjust and approach this new style snowboarding. I'm very excited for it.",

These exercises help build your foundation as a snowboarder while increasing your range of motion that's going to give you way more power. Very simple motions, very delicate, but the benefit they have to learning how to move your body and controlling if you're in your healthy range is really hard to even comprehend because it's just so useful. So, the first thing I do is I think it's called good mornings. And these are just really great because snowboarding uses a lot of hip, a lot of lower back, and a lot of hinging and like pulling through. So, it's really good to go and get those muscles activated and strong. So, for this, all you want to do is put your front foot forward, a little bit angled in towards the left, not much, but slight. Then, you want to take your back foot and put around 10% weight on it, having your toes. Your stance should be pretty close like this. And this is where the motion is a little bit complex and a little bit nuanced. You want to go suck in your ribs, get completely tall and extended, and then just tilt your hips back, pulling your hips up into the air. And you should feel a pretty intense burn in your left side of your glute all the way through. And then we want to try flex it and pull it back up.",

      "fullText": "in this video we got another 10 life-changing tips that are going to absolutely blow your mind in [Music] apart whenever spinning it's crucial to make sure your spot is positioned under your arm if you go in spot over your arm it's going to elongate your torso making it so you can't hold your constant spot and keep your head in position and especially on backside it'll elongate you make you snap and start caving you in this is why we need to make sure our spot is always positioned underneath our armpits I'm not looking forward to this but I'm going to try demo spotting over the shoulder so coming in looking coming around see how that just throws off my full axis rotation and everything that's why we want to keep our spot under and centered we never want to elongate so every single time you do a spin make sure that you're going in coming around nice and patient spotting underneath that arm that's letting you go and spot the whole duration of the landing and it's going to going give you so much more control and style on every jump whenever dropping into rails it's important to make sure that you're riding in in a stacked position this stack position gives you control and power same with jumps you want to be in a stack position and from there we can Shifty it out if you come in with your hips open it's going to be really hard to bend go and shift and rebalance because you're doing extra movements so by staying stacked in the position we want to be on on the rail we can go and be ready to absorb it tackle it and Val get us prepared to handle any Funk so when you're riding into features make sure you're squared in your comfortable stack position and that's going to increase your success rate by so much everyone knows for something like a box you don't need to jump on there's nothing to clip over so I can just ride straight maintain tail pressure I'm okay but this is actually true for down rails as well just by maintaining straight pressure I actually don't need to pop my board at all and this is because the tail of your snowboard just by going and focusing and making sure it's maintaining contact with the lift it'll naturally put the nose of your snowboard over a rail so just by maintaining a strong position using the full length of the takeoff and the full length of your snowboard you'll naturally be in a position over a rail letting you get on with a lot less extension making it way more consistent when riding rails you want to keep a little more Bend in your legs than normal this is because we want you to have range of motion so when we pop up we can maintain a little bit of bend the whole time we never want to go and pop up and get our legs fully straight because that's going to make us really have bad control so maintain a little bit more bending the legs more bending the body because this will make it so you can go and extend the legs and meet the rail more Bend makes it so I can go and still extend meet the feature hit my whole pop range while maintaining my stack point we're never trying to go and pop ourselves out of that stck position so by adding a little bit more bend it lets us go and accelerate while keeping our balance point in the same squat making rails so much safer this one tip is going to save you countless Falls and rails and that tip if you're coming off early go with it balls on Rails happen when you try to go and fight your momentum and break your set position so if you find yourself not getting all the way onto a rail coming off that's okay just go with that momentum there's nothing wrong with popping up and coming off early and in fact rails aren't as much of a balancing path we're not trying to go on pivot and rebalance like Tony Hawk Pro Skater instead it's a takeoff challenge get a good takeoff get on the rail smooth and that'll let you lock it into the end but if you don't get on the rail Smo just go wherever your momentum takes you because that's going to save you so many Falls and so much pain there's a big misconception where power comes from snowboarding a lot of people think the harder you snap power you get but if you snap too soon delay it it's going to thr up your takeoff throw up your control of the landing and just hurt everything and that's why power on jumps doesn't come from a fast snap motion instead it comes from smoothness and consistency you'll get way more power off the lip of a jump by maintaining the same controlled upper body rotation speed then you will growing fast and then slowing it down because if you snap too fast and need to delay that motion you're stopping your rotational momentum and that's delaying all the benefits you're getting from going and trying to go and snap harder making the rotation harder while giving you less control so whenever you're going and doing a spin instead of thinking about throwing hard think about throwing smooth and maintaining your upper body momentum as long as you can the larger your backside spin the more you can lead up your upper body something on back one you're hardly leading at all a backside 360 a little bit more backside 540 a little bit more and on something like a backside 7 you're rotating your upper body as much as you can off the lift leading the rotation so your upper body will be rotated around 180 and this is because it takes time for your legs to catch up so if you over snap like a backside 360 you're not going to have any trick left by the time your legs catch up but on back seven you have that room and you're aiming to grab at 270 so the bigger your backside spin the more you can lead with your upper body when spinning it's really important to be patient and wait to grab your spins pop up get the full rotation then grab so coming up rotating then grabbing and that's going to give you so much more control so even there where I got a bad takeoff got a bad snap because I waited to go and grab the spin it let me go and give that little bit of extra rotation and pull into it so whenever you're going and doing a spin and you want to add a grab remember set your spin throw it and once you're in the air and feeling in control then you grab by doing this you'll get so much more control and your jumps will be way more stylish for it when doing something like a backside board slide we don't want to start straight and then try to enter our backside board side position instead we want to PR UL have our body in a backside board side position so then we can just counter rotate so we're coming in preemptively positioning our body and this is letting us get that nice bit of control whenever you're doing a board slide maintain a nice stack position because that's going to give you so much more power we don't want to go from a tall position into a board slide position instead we want to hold our board slide position and going just counter rotate into that board slide this will go in limit the Motions you need to do and let you keep your Center balance set on the same point making board slides way easier every time you hit a rail or a box you're going to be jumping sideways onto it and if you go sideways onto a rail it's going to create something called sideways momentum and to stop sideways momentum we do something called hitting the rail angled so this is hitting the rail slightly from the side to kill that momentum not very noticeable on a 50/50 but on something like the backside board slide it's way more noticeable so I'm coming in hitting the side of a rail and this is letting me kill that momentum so even can like over St there as then walk in come in hit the side come down by going and hitting the side of the rail it stops your sideways momentum and lets you go and fully control the feature if you don't do this you're just going to slide off the far side and it's not going to let you lock in so every time you're doing a board side 50/50 even if it's subtle make you're hitting the rail slightly angled towards the side that you're taking off from",

      "fullText": "in this video we're going cross compare one of my front side 360s with one of my patreon subscribers front side 360s in order to go and figure out what he can do to improve and in the process learn some really cool fundamental principles about this trick so first of all what's going wrong what's Happening Here is he's opening his upper body preemptively this is throwing off his balanced position making him rely on other principles to get that rotation around and making it so he can't get a super clean pop off the lip uh the reason why opening your chest early is so problematic is a few things first of all it limits your range of motion how every spin works on a snowboard is you're trying to channel the energy through every possible point you can so here in order to do that I'm keeping my shoulders squared off my hips squared off and this is giving me full range of motion to use my hips upper body just every part of my body to link together in order to increase the range of motion I can use to snap off the lip the more range of motion you have off the lip the more power you'll be able to generate and the less likely you will be to overextend your body position but when you go and open your upper body preemptively it really limits your amount of range of motion you can use to generate power so here since his chest is already fully open he's not able to go and rotate if you rotate your front side spin past this 90 point you're not going to be able to keep your spot forward making it so you can't use the constant spot what's a really important part of any front side 360 so why is he opening his chest this is actually pretty interesting so the main reason opening your chest is a problem is because it limits power but we can see in this video he gets a front side 360 around just fine so his issue isn't power and trying to throw early because he's actually not throwing at all this is because of the grab he's doing this grab is called the stalefish and stale fishes are very interesting because they go and speed up your front side 360 by going and sort of kicking your back leg around and using your front leg as like a pivot so on a stale fish you actually don't need to snap the front fre at all instead you can rely on The Tweak and the throw of the hips in order to get that been around and because of this lies the issue because he doesn't need to worry about generating snap and power instead he's preemptively entering his front side 360 position so see this body position here and look at how his weight is centered and his back his round he's holding this position through the full duration of the jump so he's popping up and he's in that same position he was on the in run in the air so this means he's trying to get into a position he's comfortable in too soon so the solution for that is being patient focusing on Snap focusing on your pop but that's a little too simple this is a deep video analysis so we're going to talk about why this is happening and it's happening in a place that you might not expect right here notice the two differences here in this position I have my upper body set forward bend in my knees in comparison he's standing completely straight over both legs but reason why this is problematic is very sneaky and really cool so because I'm keeping my upper body more hunched over this makes it so when I go and transition to my heel Edge I don't need to do a very big motion and that's because if you want to keep your weight loaded onto your heel Edge you need to go and offset this by dropping your hips putting your upper body forward in order to keep your Center balance over the board when you go and start in this tall position though you need to do a really big motion to shift into this heel head position so the solution for this is doing a more bent down angled position on the toe Edge because that makes it so I can go and shift to my heel edge with a very minimal motion so let's pay really close attention to that see my tow Edge position holding that toe Edge closed off and as I switch my heel Edge my position hardly changes and a really important note for when I am changing this Edge is pay attention to this hand here as I go and get onto my heel Edge I'm dropping it and pulling it to my back knee so as I go and transfer onto my heel Edge I'm pulling deeper into my clothes off position increasing my maximum range of motion now let's go compare that to what my patreon member is doing so he's coming in tall and because he's coming in tall he needs to go and shift his body weight in order to get onto that heel Edge because getting onto the heels from here if you just lean you're going to have too much weight set away from your snowboard so how he goes and gets this weight while also setting himself up for the front side 360 is through opening the hips opening the hips is a great way to go and get pressure onto your Edge it lets you go and use more pivot Points but when you're going and doing it for something like a front 360 is going to cause a couple really gnarly problems first of all when you're straight like this and you want to get pressure the only thing you can really do is try to go and shift your upper body forward as you have your back leg Bend and this front leg extend this is making it so his body weight is really not stacked over the center of his board and he's using more variables if we compare that I'm trying to keep relatively stacked over my board both legs with the same amount of Bend so here his problem is that he's going and shifting into this open hip position and in order to hold this heel Edge pressure from this position you need to go and counterbalance but when you counterbalance this way and put your weight onto your heel Edge this way it goes and makes it so your butt drops back to your back edge of your board this is going to make it so as you go and generate power you're instead of generating power straight into your snowboard more and more of it's being driven into uh the bottom bottom left side of your snowboard and when you go and drive power into a narrow point of your snowboard it's going to make it so you can't disperse as much energy and we can see that here as he goes and pops up he's going and getting his feet kicked out in front of him see how his body weight is now not centered over his board you really want to be popping straight up over top of your snowboard because that's going to give you more power and it's going to give you more efficient power straight up and down pushing you into the air there's another couple things that are really problematic about this position the first one is because of the upper body so hinged forward and the hips are rotated it's a lot of motion to try extend out of if you go on push and try to add power in this position it's going to exaggerate your weight to where it's set and where it's set is over on the back foot or on that tail Edge pressure so if you try to go and fully pop up from this position so I want you to use your imagination a bit imagine if he fully extended in this position his whole body would be angled out to the side so the way to counter this is to let the upper body hinge forward like you would be in the front side 360 air and when you go and leave the takeoff with this bending the legs bending the Torso it's going to make it so you're absorbing the takeoff the reason why we're trying to extend our legs and keep them straight is so that the jump doesn't GS out and we're doing this to get match with the angle of the takeoff here he actually does a really good job and a cool principle for jumping if you aren't aware is you want to match the angle of the takeoff that's why we go and shift our weight slightly to our back foot so we can maintain contact the takeoff and the tail slides off because by matching the angle of the takeoff it puts you up to perfectly match the angle of the landing because the takeoffs angled and the landing's angled matching the angle of the takeoff will naturally make you match the angle of the landing so in order to go and fix this there's going to be a few things you want to do first come in with a more bent position having your upper body come forward hinging forward more bending your legs keeping your Center balance more over your board if it's more Bend Val make it so as you shift to your heel Edge you won't need to go and do as big of a motion letting you get that heel Edge in a smoother fashion and as you get onto your heel Edge instead of opening your chest to a jump I want you to go and focus on keeping the shoulder squared with your snowboard I also want you to focus on keeping your knees squared together not letting this KNE knee come in because that's going to shift your weight over to the tail of your snowboard making it so when you pop up you're not getting that full explosion off your board that's putting straight into the air and from there I want you to stop doing the stalefish grab you're great up a stalefish grab it's working for you but it's holding you back because you relying on it for the spin grabs are a great addition to the spin but we never want to rely on them in order to get the trick around this starts becoming true around 7 you want to grab pretty much every single 720 but up in 27s this is really true so stop grabbing the stale fish because your rotation your spot in the air is all really good how you're positioning and holding yourself in the air your Center balance is really good but we need to go from that powerful takeoff that powerful pop and then enter that position so get that nice extension nice range of motion from that close-off position and then bring yourself up into that nice front side 360 position and the last thing we'll go and comment on here is your spot you're doing a really good job spotting The Landing the whole way but where you go and start losing it isn't right here right here your spots awesome looking right where you need to but right before your snowboard lands you look up straight out so see here your head is positioned looking straight this is going to make it so your weight is being uh set now over flat base and that's why you're going and getting this little bit of slip out so you just need to hold your spot a little bit longer make sure you're holding your spot in this position and you my content contact with a snow and then hold it a little longer and for anyone watching this video that's like hey Tavis how can I go and get my video broken

So, he's only using enough force in order to get him into a transition of a feature because if he overshoots this, he's going to be in serious trouble.

This is so important when you're hitting these super fast transitions is making sure that you're preemptively setting your upper body into the angle you want to land in. So here he has to take off slightly on a heel ledge angle. How is he going and compensating for this? We can see that his weight now is set a little bit more over his heels.

      "fullText": "So let's go and break it down all the way from the start. So first things first, I want you to pay attention to how little he's extending his legs. This is such an important thing for highlevel rail riding and it's the fact that if you ride off your tail, you don't need to extend your legs and you want as little height to get onto that rail as possible. So, what's more important is maintaining the same position you want to be in for the actual backside board slide coming off the takeoff. And that doesn't mean as much like chest being opened. It more means the bend in your legs and bend in your upper body correlation. This makes it so instead of extending the knee should compress again, all he needs to do is activate his counter rotation. And as he goes and hits his board slide, notice how he's landing with his arm not all the way in its max rotated position. This is letting him curate a little bit of rotational energy as that arm continues to rotate. This is my big problem and a big problem I see with back pretzels is the fact that I'll land with my arms all the way over here. So I have nothing generating rotation only letting me use counter rotation. But because he's letting his upper body land in a more neutral position and carrying it through, he's now able to go and keep that momentum going just ever so slightly. We can see that it stops a little bit, but as it's stopping, he's shifting his weight more and more onto his front leg. That's opening the range of motion in his hips, allowing him to go and get his upper body more and more exaggerated. And this also has the added effect of making it so he has even board pressure. Even board pressure is one of the key things for getting a clean 2 somebody out on a rail because if you're sagging this way, it's going to be easier to rotate, but you're going to risk clipping the rail and popping off to the side. So, by going and exaggerating this position, and we see this leg extended, this knee coming in, pushing in. Everything is being done in order to increase the pressure on that front foot and increase the range of motion in his hips. And then he continues that momentum all the way to its max. And that's building the tension of the core, building the torsion, and that's letting him go and snap it all the way back. And look at how exaggerated this motion is. He's going and using almost completely counter rotation here. Uh, and that makes me actually I need to pull back with this.",

      "fullText": "That's why they take so much more power than like back fives or versus like it's really easy to go front seven from front five because you're able to use that counter rotation, keep it blind. But for this rotation, I really need to make sure that my this arm right here is pulling and leading the rotation. But see how it's sort of like blocking my body. This means I'm not going to be able to utilize any counter rotation because your back arm needs to be leading so you can go and pull it back across your body. And that's going to make it so I'd have to go and get the perfect amount of snap off a jump. So you can see here I'm landing super heel heavy under rotated slightly. You're just not going to be able to land from this spot. I would need to get the shoulder over more, back arm rotated more in order to get to the toes. And then we're getting very touchy. I really want to be finishing these tricks with enough time to let the upper body keep rotating and counter rotate the lower body around. Since I'm spinning so much, it's going to be really hard to like lock in and land bolts. If you're not using a little bit of counter rotation to slow down your maximum rotation velocity. If you don't know, uh, when you utilize counter rotation, well, it does speed up your spin, it is also slowing down your maximum spinning velocity because you're going like pulling in a different way. So, it's really, really useful for helping you land these big rotations and your rotations in general, but it's sort of crucial for this. So, how do I go and fix this? Also, if you haven't noticed, this video is going to be ridiculous longly long, but not much I can do about it. So, I think to fix this, I need to first fix this takeoff. I can't have it this flat, this downhill. I'm going to need to make it so I'm going throwing and lifting my chest more over top. So, you can see I'm getting like good rotation here, but look at how angled my body is. I think I need this to be more flat. And the only way I'm going to be able to get this more flat is to get taller off the takeoff here. See how I'm sort of bent over? So, this is going to be what it freaking always is. I'm going need to fix my takeoffs a little bit more. So, less heel edge pressure, more tall in this position, letting me stand taller. And that should let me snap taller. And that should make it so it's less cked. And being less cked will make it so as I go and pull into this second spot part part of a spin, it won't be as dipped because I won't be flipping as much. And hopefully that'll let me keep my spot on the knuckle a little bit more. So spotting on the knuckle here and then at this point I can like pull in and get the dip going. So it's not far off. Could land this. Uh I've seen them done like this before, but it's a little bit too risky of an axis rotation for me to want to bring to snow. I don't really need that much heat in my life.",

      "fullText": "in this video we're going to break down your carving to see how you can get more power and get lower to that snow first of all I must know these carves are pretty sick but that said there's going to be some small changes you can make that are going to be an absolute GameChanger for amount of power you're getting out of each turn so let's go and break that that down first of all I want to talk about this form here when this is good riding posture and good positioning there's a couple things that are holding you back for doing the maneuver you're trying to do and that is having your weight set over his front foot I really like how your chest is open leading up your hips but having your weight set over your front foot like this is making it so you can't load up pressure on your Edge and can't get that tortion from your board but you can by having your weight centered or over your back foot generally the front foot isn't as good of a spot to have your weight set because it's going to go and make it so your back foot is a little bit lighter so it's harder to go and lock in and push through those turns because when we go and watch this turn we can see that you're going and moving to your back back foot loading up on it and pushing through your hips loading on that back foot that's the principle for all of turning so if you start on your front foot but load to your back foot you're adding an unnecessary movement and that movement is you starting off your weight over here on the front foot moving to Center then moving to back foot that's adding a cross-directional momentum to your body Mo motions so to fix this all you need to do is instead of having your weight set here on your front foot foot just keep it more centered keep it towards the back foot and that'll give you a better platform to set up for this turn but the big thing that you can do here to start getting more power and feeling in more control is right here you're unweighting and waiting the first thing I want to note is you're going and extending too much see how your legs are completely straight you never want to fully extend your legs and have your upper body getting extended and Tall because that's going to make it so you don't have your weight set on your feet and you're not going to have any micro adjust adjustment possibilities straight legs don't give you any room to control so we want to avoid getting straight legs basically at any point in snowboarding straight legs are something to be avoided so this is telling us that you're just using a little bit too much upwards motion and you're going and holding it for a little bit unnecessary amount of time so we can see right here you're going from a little bit of vent position and then going very tall and holding it so what I'd recommend here is first you can just not extend as much Val make it easy or you can go if you want that bigger motion add a little bit more Ben to your legs the only problem with this motion this lifting is that you're lifting and getting your legs completely straight and that's making it so your chest goes tall making you light disconnecting the engagement of your core and your Edge what brings us into the next thing that you can go and improve upon and that is setting your weight back down onto your Edge see how you're going from your tall position and you're letting your upper body come lean down into your board this is what you want to do to build weight on your Edge but only issue here is your flat based at this moment so this hole up to down motion hasn't been used to actually generate any speed any power into that edge because you're squatting down as your flat based and we can see this through the whole duration where you're going and using your basically your whole range of motion from up to down while maintaining a flat base to do a powerful turn and really get that carve working for you what you want to do is do your lift up not so much about your extending get onto your tow Edge and once you're on your toe Edge then you push pressure into it then you push weight into it and as you push your weight into it you're going to accelerate right now you're basically going completely flat base into your hand touches and the only thing helping you get in this turn is your sideways momentum so you do a great job when you're at this point but we want to get it so if you want to get even lower you want to Rel you're going to rely Less on leaning because leaning is limited by speed that's why this hand needs to come out because you're going too slow for this drastic of a turn but if you go and do the same exact motion you're doing just to a lesser extent here and later here that's going to make it so you're accelerating through this whole duration of switching to your tow Edge and building up on it so when you get to that point where you're lower to the ground putting the hand down you have more speed more velocity and that way you can hold more traction and get lower to the snow without needing to worry about falling over over and that's how you can start connecting it building power and what we really want to see out of these turns is for them to go like this speeding up speeding up then as you lighten up slowing down slowing down getting on your back tow Edge speeding up speeding up accelerating right at the point where you're trying to hit your maximum turn so final recap all you need to do is first keep your weight more centered over your board next don't go and extend your chest so high and don't fully straighten out your legs you can do this by keeping a little bit Bend more Bend in them or just extending less and lastly don't go and start loading pressure on that edge until you're on your toe Edge make sure that your toe Edge is set in place before you start squatting down into it because this is not fully utilizing the power you have as a rider so make these changes and I think it's going to make your carving way more explosive way more fun and should let you get way lower turns let me know how it goes and let me know if you need any more feedback for anyone watching this video you can get feedback just like this on addiction plus enjoy and happy shredding",

So, the first thing that we're going to need to make sure we have locked in is our position. We covered in the last video, but it's worth talking about because it's so important. If we're too straight and tall, it's going to be impossible to clear our spot over at that point. And that's going to make it so people are going to be tempted to go and lean forward or rounding the spine. You really don't want to be rounding the spine or hinging at the hips because when you go and bounce, your weight's going to be very set over your toes and it's going to really compromise your back. So, the only way to keep our head in this position with being strong is to go have a little bit of bend in the legs, a little bit of hinge in the hips, and have your chin come down naturally.",

It's the same angle throughout the full duration. This is why some snowboards make things look so effortless. And that's because just by preemptively setting yourself up into the body posture or that's correct for the trick, you can simply go and execute straight power into it. And that's going to make it so these all work. If I was completely centered of my board and I tried to bounce this, it would be almost impossible to stagger the extension of my legs. But because my hips are shifted back here, it's almost impossible for me to go and pop in a way that wouldn't work for the jump. So, all I need to do is take the same riding position that I want to lock ride in, land in, and utilize it. For this clip, I'm demonstrating a really common mistake on a front side 360. Yet, you'll notice I'm landing it. So, why can I go and land a front side 360 even when trying to do everything wrong? And we can really see, look at how my hips are shifted towards this back leg, upper body pulled forward. The thing I really want to note about this is I'm not letting my weight shift towards my heel edge. I'm making sure to always go and pull my upper body forward in correlation to the hips going back. This front side 360 here is almost perfect except for the fact that he's going and having his weight shifted all the way to the heels. So, he's not pulling his upper body forward enough in correlation to uh the bend in his legs and that's making it so his rotation set over his heels. And the reason why I included that is because that is so important here, the balance. We're not trying to lean back. We're not trying to shift our weight all the way over.",

      "fullText": "hello my brave soldiers in this video we're going to attempt to Impossible and try to wrap our minds around this 203e 40 of Madness this is truly a trick that boggles the mind and crushes the spirit so we're going to do our best to break it down figure out what the hell is happening in snowboarding to make this thing even possible it is truly mindboggling so do not attempt this at home I am somewhat professional so I the most qualified person to go and take on this feet and not only that we're also going to compare it to some of my riding to see how we Stack Up and how we can improve so let's go and break down the craziest trick I've ever seen done so the first thing we're going to note is this takeoff is absolutely perfect notice how he's coming into a jump all the way on the far side this is letting him take a very very light angle and that's really important for a big trick like this because it makes it so you can stand really tall over top of your board and the taller you are over the board the more range of motion and body movement you'll be able to use to generate power and he needs all the power he can get so he's getting on that heel Edge very early very slight and staying very tall and what he's trying to do while exiting this heelside turn is make sure that his board is maintaining pointed towards the left corner of the jump this is going to give him more range of motion to open the hips letting him wind up more and get more power and we can really see that his chest is already open hips open everything point pointed towards that corner and then this is really important as well he's doing a very similar spoon transition that you see from any snowboarder he's going from heelside to flat base as he's going up that transition it's a little bit delayed because it's such a big jump but he's still wanting to hold that little bit of flat Bess before getting on his Edge and as he gets onto his edge here it goes ooh that's really interesting look at how long his board is staying angled towards the left side I normally have my boards go and get straight pretty much as soon as I finish my wind up but he's holding that angle for a very long period of time what this is doing is making it so as he snaps off his board is staying a little bit straighter giving him more power okay let's look at the arm positioning here so he's staying very closed off something really cool to note here is look at how long he's delay in opening his arms he basically only op opens them and holds it for for a split millisecond before snapping this is because your core actually acts a bit like an elastic if you go and open up and hold a position for a long time and then try to move it won't have as much power as if you go and wind up and immediately snap so he's using that to his Advantage he's holding his chest open board open and then at the last second he's winding up so perfect timing he can mutely snap as hard as he can and he goes and finishes snapping right off a takeoff and this is where the trick starts getting pretty Nifty so when you snap this hard it's going to determine your axis of rotation a lot and he's doing something called the constant core let's just watch through this quick and you can see that he's maintaining the same axis rotation throughout the whole spin uh this is really important for these bigger rotations because it makes it so you can go and spot the knuckle the whole time so see his head is locked in place on that knuckle through the whole duration of his trick that is what's letting him go and spin this much and go and still get in control and see that's why we haven't been able to see these big of rotations before because people were doing them more Flippy and if you do something like a flip you're going to lose the spot every time so it gets very disorientating but here it honestly will look to him probably like he's not even spinning that much because his head will be so locked and focused and the key part to getting that axis rotation come in is all in this even though it's slightly corked look at how straight he's keeping his body this is because he's doing the perfect snapped over his tail where he's fully extended and in order to adjust his axis rotation he's not leaning forward he's not thring down he's just going and shifting his whole body to throw over that back leg giving him Max snap off his back foot think of this as like an ollie you pop off that back foot makes it so you snap off that tail get extra pop so shifting his whole weight back goes and gives him more pop more power while also putting him into the perfect axis rotation and that's really where this Mastery comes from is the ability to go and snap it and get holding that position so smooth so the Precision he needs to go and snap this hard will keeping this AIS of rotation is really just pretty hard to grasp everyone when they throw spins is like on a range and it's really hard to go and hit the perfect form this is the perfect angle perfect axis and let's watch his head positioning here so he snaps that hard yet he still grabs at 270 that is super proper a lot of people when by do these big tricks have a hard time get didn't grab but here grabs it right away and you can see that he's spotting forward the reason why he's spotting forward here is because he doesn't want to lead the rotation with his head even though he's doing a big spin leading the spin with your head will make it so your body needs to play catchup so it's actually the most efficient to generate momentum while keeping everything tight and connected that's making it so he's able to go and tighten up and immediately he's in his fully tucked position with everything tight working together right at free 6 that is super early to get into this position I'm usually not fully wound up and tight on like my du back 10s until like 450 and from there all it is is dropping that shoulder and pulling into the spin uh his head is going to stay in the same position you can see he's tucking his legs with his back arm so he doesn't have control about that and this is literally just using his chin to pull around the spin keeping that spot in the same place and then pulling into this Landing is really impressive what he's doing is because this is rotating so fast and there's so much rotational Force he needs to do a lot in order to not slip out and continue spinning on the landing so to do that what he's doing is he's letting go of the grab at 180 and look at his head position he has his board rotated to completely 180s more than he has his upper body what this does is it makes it so he needs to utilize counter rotation so see how his arms are now coming out and winding when you use counter rotation in a spin F first it speeds up your spin but if it's done this early it actually slows down your spin because when you counter rotate you disconnect your upper and lower body and that makes it so you're disconnected and you're not continuing your spinning momentum so counter rotation when it's good for speeding up like a 180 if done too soon it will completely halt your rotation so he's doing that on purpose letting go of a grab a bit early purposely using counter rotation a bit early and that's Mak it so he's coming into the landing with minimal momentum and that's the only way he can land this thing it also helps that he's going this huge easier to stop momentum when you're going big doesn't mean like I have no idea how he landed that he went massive and that's a really important part of this trick I think is actually going massive because you're keeping your spot forward it's if you're doing like a front side trick or yeah if you're doing like a front side free in a park a front seven you're trying to keep your eye Onis knuckle tracking but what these guys need to do that's way different from what we're doing on like her smaller tricks is they need to keep her spot in the forward Direction so he's not spotting the knuckle inste instead he's spotting forward toward towards where he's landing and that's pretty normal on backs side but I see that on front side with these Riders as well so pretty interesting that they had to take this new approach because we're Landing so far down past the knuckle they're literally changing how they spot ver tricks uh I do with some s when I overshoot but something on like this big of a scale truly a work of art so yeah that's that's the best I got for how this trick works uh obviously I don't have it fully figured out because I can't do it so let's go and compare that a little bit to my form because I have been studying the Japanese a lot and I have been trying to go and get my form as close to bears as possible so let's see what's happening here so first uh we can already notice a big difference uh coming in with like the same angle same Edge pressure but he's doing such a better job at staying stacked over top of his board V I am see how I'm rounding a bit I got this curvature that's making it so my weight is set more over my butt instead of my board and that's going to make it so my board's doing more transfer and it's hard to stay tall over top of it so he already has me beat by a lot on the heelside carve I got to work on that I'm it's something I'm working on getting better at and the next thing he's doing is he's doing a much more mellow line this is also because it's a bigger jump so we need to take that into consideration but I really like how his body staying tall like FS see how my upper body is super over and my boards getting further away from my body this is a compromised position not the best for building power and then we can see that's pretty cool we both put our hands together before doing the spin I don't know why I do that it's practically inefficient but it feels pretty good uh and then the wind up m so he's also going and holding the wound up position later than me he gets into his wound up position slower look at how casually he's winding up his arms compared to me basically as soon as I get on my tow Edge I'm reaching my maximum position this is making it so I need to hold it for longer and that causes a couple of things since it's such a maximum extension wound up position it'll make it so your toes digging a little bit more causing you to lean a little bit more since he's taking a slower approach it's helping him stay tall over his board and that's giving him more Edge grip giving him more range of motion to wind up and to really utilize those hips as you start leaning forward it's hard to stay wound up and open and that's making it so I'm throwing slightly earlier than him uh let's see what positions here okay this is interesting and something I'll need to look at more furly but see how his back leg still a little bit bent and mine's completely straight up this point this might tell me that I'm taking off slightly front foot uh heavy where I'm like loading my pressure on my front foot as my back foot's getting straight I've noticed that before but that could be something that I need to think about addressing and then the snap [Music] through uh pretty similar the difference is his snap is better than mine like look at how much extension he has in the body how completely straight of a body he has here I have like a slight bit of angle slight bit of tilt in the hips and my body isn't leading as much I don't need to Le that much but still that's just like that's just this takeoff done perfectly but we're doing the same you can see that I'm not like ridiculously far away but see the little details and everything working together so perfectly that gives him such a big difference uh I guess we should look at the tricks because the tricks are important too most of these tricks is are decided off the takeoff and were're different tricks so I didn't worry about it that much but that's my bad anyway so snapping down uh yeah his motions just way cleaner less hesitation less flaws uh more efficiency and that's resulting in him being getting getting a lot more power and being able to get into his board but you can see I'm trying to incorporate the constant spot as well head down tracking it uh I just have to do what another 1260 after thatat and I'll be ready for X Games so yeah that's the video that's me trying to wrap my head around this trick uh if we can go and get to 10 million subscribers I will dedicate my life to riding at the airbag and I can 2360 I promise you that I don't care if it takes five or 10 years so let's go 10 million subscribers and we will go learn the 2360 in probably like a decade or two awesome thanks for watching we'll see you next time",

I've been popping Advil and a and Tylenol on and off this whole trip it's just I have some hip injuries I have some body problems and I'm spending way too much money to risk having a bad day so I'm taking the L on the organs but it's been really helping and it's going to allow me to do 2 Days in a row here the plan for today get used to a medium bag hopefully spin some cab on it get some front TS going and then just build up all the fundamentals I need because the next days I'm going to be riding the mega mega bag so I'm very stoked about that my arms are around you and the spirits are so high can't let this die it's not one be people say it's all what they may do cuz words are actions going me on the [Music] [Applause] [Music] cover share your secrets with me come with [Music] me try toide uh super big update I've been a total fool I've been buying the wrong airbag each day spending an extra $100 per day riding what just really hurts when I heard that but they were so clutch and they gave me the full refund got it stored for me I had my friend go and uh help converse with them and they refunded me no problem I'm use the second half of the day to build up some courage and drop and switch [Music] [Music] going into session two session one went decent I used a little bit too much time trying some front 10 variations that didn't really pan out and used a little bit too much energy in my hips so now my hip's feeling pretty weak but I'll use that as a good opportunity to take a step back and focus on my back Breeze in front freeze just try to get those good takeoffs I'm taking tomorrow off so we can really push it today and we just want to get those fundamentals really solid because we be riding the bigger airbag the next days so let's go and get back at [Music] it like the letter I'm making several I know the mission the I made all of my pass last like running a race with you sing I keep it coming like this isff and if I'm stumbling I'm in the gra never going I

eloh with the melody and then he Supply the bread 70 keep it Heavenly everybody get the bread I went and learned my first new double in 5 years and it felt just like I imagined it looked just like I imagined it would look and it felt so good I always fought like what's the point of learning cab dub 9 I can only do cab flat 10 it's so much safer but the point is it's really freaking fun and I just had such a fun time doing that trick I did it so many times I got to a point where I was like thinking about other stuff in the air what you shouldn't do but it was so cold I was like feeling so awful but got some sick back 12s got some awesome C of NS and end up being one of the best nights I've I've had ever this is such a good day for Co just isn't even phasing me right now that said I think I have used every single muscle of my body to its maximum and tomorrow I fear for the damages that await me but it was a great day and I can't wait to get back out here and train again I did 40 hits today so we won't be going over all of them but we're going to cover some of the main points from today see what can be learned from it and where I can improve for next time starting with these front side 10 my front tens were sort of tilt Throne I just found out that I've been overpaying for the airbag accidentally paying an extra 100 Canadian each day so like that's like an extra 220 American I was down so that was in my head on every single one of these hits and it made me sort of tilt frow my spins and it caused me to get all of my old problems back that's pre-s spinning opening up and it's causing a lot of drift but the main area it's coming from is my Approach I'm approaching too heavy on my toe Edge and M making it so I have a lot of sideways momentum when coming up with the lip of a jump when you come up to the jump with a bunch of sideways momentum it's going to make it so you're skidding a bit and that's going to make it so you need to go and use your upper body to counterbalance not letting you be tall over top of your snowboard and if you're going and having this position while trying to generate snap and frow the thing that's going to happen is it's going to open your hips and it's going to make you go and start pre-s spinning off a jump so I'm going to go and really focus on using less toe pressure a smaller setup carve and then transitioning to the heel sooner and that should let me stay more over the center of my snowboard I'm also going to think about taking off a little bit of off my tow Edge not a bunch but you can see that I'm really heavy on my heels here so I'm going try to set my weight from here over here just trying to get it more like a hard way and hopefully that will help me get a straighter takeoff and make these front side spins better in the future the next thing I did is I did my first cab spins on the big jump and they went pretty decent I managed to make a change that I'm really excited about and that is grabbing a lot sooner so normally when I do cab spins I can't grab until like 450 when I'm doing like cab 9es because I ye my body off and takeoff so hard here I went and cut that yeet short and that let me go and get the grab at 270 what's a really reasonable time to be grabbing and hold it through the full duration the problem with it is I went and scuffed my takeoff and really held this open takeoff position for a long period of time you can see how Ang I am on that takeoff what happens when you're this angled this fully thrown before leaving off the lip is you don't have much rotational momentum and that's why when I'm spinning around I'm spinning so slow and I'm hardly making it through the full 900 even though this airbags big enough for nines easily so what I'm going to do to try fix this is delay this motion delay my snap and delay my timing the most important part of this is you might have guessed it the trans trans you can see I'm doing just like on my front side a really aggressive toe transition switching to my heels after going through the spoon of a jump this is just giving me too much sideways momentum making it really hard to stay tall over my board causing the same leaned posture and on this lean posture it doesn't let you go and hold your arms as wound up so when you throw you're going to have a smaller range of motion what isn't even my main issue my main issue is this I'm halfway through a jump haven't thrown but I've let my my upper body tilt open towards the far corner and that's really limiting my range of motion so then as I snap I'm going to go and have a very small kind of rotation motion to play with so I need to go focus on staying more stacked over my board more wound up with the body and then delaying the snap so I can leave in a straighter line with more momentum being carried through the spin and that should result in a cab n that comes around a lot easier and then it should let me spin bigger tricks after that then moving into the nighttime I went and got a few uh back 12s going but I was a little bit too drifty here and you don't want to be drifting this much when you're Landing fakey because it's going to make it so you have to really dig in that tow Edge and it's going to be harder to stomp it clean so how I'm planning on fixing this is a couple things first of all I want to go and get my setup carve way less wide so see how I'm really pushing the side of the airbag here I want to try narrow this in closer to the center but I'll make it so I don't have as much distance to travel to my toe Edge I'm hoping that'll make it so I have less sideways momentum and I'm just going to try to do the transfer a little bit sooner I'm transfering sooner than I was when I first got here but I think I could do it a little bit earlier and that'll just give me more time to get on my toes combine that with less angle of approach and hopefully it will let me stay a little more stacked and Tall which should let me me go and get rid of this last little bit of drift because right now my head position is right here but I want to try get it right over top of my snowboard because that's just going to mean that my weight is completely set over top of a board so then when I go and try muster this much power I won't be going and throwing forward instead I'll be throwing more down over my board and that should eliminate this little bit of drift because you can see that my takeoff is pretty straight if I had less tow pressure unless lean forward with fist R of a takeoff the drift wouldn't be a serious issue so we're going to go and make that change and now into the highlight of my night and that is doing my cab underflip doubles this is my first time learning a new double in 5 years so I was extremely nervous I almost talked myself out of trying it but I was like screw it I'm all the way in Japan I'm just going to give it a go and my first attempt I knew instantly that I was going to be okay as soon as I took off in the A and that's because of the way I do it notice how my head is able to spot the landing of the airbag the whole time this means that I can see where I'm going through the air and if I can spot where I'm at I'm not really scared doing a double because it hardly feels like two flips because instead you're feeling your vision just rotate with you making it so it's way less scary than if you have to go blind two times it's basically like a spin at that point point so the first one went good I would have landed that one on snow because I was like surprised that it went so good and then after that I just started grinding it out I did 10 of them and this was the second last one and I tried to mix up the grab and watch what happens I go and switch grabs halfway through and it makes it so my body continues to rotate throughout the spin so where I was able to hold it at 9 to4 switching to that Indie grab made it so my arm was leading for rotation and back made it so my body wanted to keep spinning and it was giving me too much spin for a flip this is a problem on the cab dub 9 but it makes me feel like I could do it for aab dub 10 and that's why I'm including it here so next time I'm trying this trick I'm going go and try switch grabs and commit to pulling the shoulder all the way over and that should work for the 1080 and that' just be really cool to go and get a different 10 variation and then moving on to for the last one we'll point out the problems and what I like about this trick for me right now because [ __ ] 9 I think is a relatively uny trick but the way I'm doing it with a stale fish it ends up being really cool looking uh and it doesn't take much power to get around because you're frosting with your hips and you're throwing your legs up by shooting your uh feet up and fr your hand into the grab it actually really puts you in a good Vortex but I honestly feel like I could add another flip to to with a little bit more practice the main issue I'm having here is I'm pre-s spinning a little bit and sliding so I'm not popping fully off the tail this means I'm going through the jump and not going very high uh would be a problem if I went to go try the triple but that said it was the first day doing it and it felt really good did 10 of them and if you're doing 10 of a trick and Landing them for my jority of a time you're in a good spot and this actually gave me the confidence that I feel like I'll be able to go this win and actually get this trick on snow if I go and try this trick again I'm just going to focus on being a little more patient with the windup a little bit flatter transition so the same training for all my cab spins will be used here but this is a way less punishing for making mistakes and that's just something cool about flip tricks in general and why you see so many people doing like double 14 variations and that's because when you start going and doing flips you're flipping more over top of your board and that's going to make it so even if you go and mess up your weight still set straight down so you're not going to get drifting unless drift just really makes tricks way easier so this was one of the most successful days I've ever had I'm so happy to learn a new double and it really just makes my whole trip feel worth it so I'd highly recommend if you get the chance come check out the airbags because they can give you that little bit of extra urge to go and learn a trick but you didn't think you were going to have in you",

So look at how much I'm extending my body and getting this pop. This would make it so it'd be very hard to go and add upper body rotation, try to snap or add any dynamics you'd need for a trick. On the right here, he actually does a really good job of maintaining tail pressure the whole way through the lip and not going and popping up early. And you can see he's actually holding more pressure on his snowboard than I am. The issue is is his upper body positioning. He's taking off in this completely centered body position. And this is going to make it so he's slightly set over his front foot.

So that's going to be the limit of your uh of your counter rotation range of motion. Let's go and work on how we can go and connect it with her spins because that's really what matters. The first thing I'd recommend doing to go and get used to this is learning how to lead the rotation of your upper body. This means that as you go and spin, you're letting your upper body slightly lead the rotation. Not a lot. Say you're doing something like a back one, you don't want to be leading and having your upper body rotated completely 180 because that's only going to let you spot forward. So what I mean by leading with your upper body is really variant on the trick. But for something like a backside 180, it's as simple as having your front shoulder slightly closed off in this position. We can only utilize counter rotation when our upper body is rotated more because we need something to pull back across our body. So if you're in a squared position and try to use counter rotation, it's not going to work. And that's why if you want to fully utilize counter rotation you're riding, you need to get comfortable with leading with your upper body. So on a front side spin, what does that look like? It looks as simple as having your chest in this position. So as you pop up, boom, your chest is right here. And on front side, you don't want to ever be leading more than this point. And as you go and rotate your front side spin, you just make sure that your front arm is slightly leading the spin because that front arm leaded position is going to let you go and counter rotate it all the way through. So, let's go and do some backside 360 uh progression with that in mind, we're going to go and instead of doing a full backside 360 because I got some unstable ground here and I'm not trying to fall down this cliff and get disastered. So, we'll just go and do it from 90. So, backside 360, get 90. And what I want you to do here is just practice going and taking your upper body, pulling it through, and then jumping up and counter rotating it. Once you get comfortable with it, you can go and do the full 360. But I highly recommend starting with a 270 because as you go and take off the backside 360 off a jump, you pop up. As you're finished popping, you're around 90 off the jump.",

And once we start getting into this, there's another really crucial principle that you need to make sure you're hitting. And that is your head positioning. Watch what happens if I try to do this, but looking over my shoulder, coming up, over the shoulder, coming around. See how that's going and elongating and disconnecting me? We can't fully utilize counter rotation without that stack position. And if you go and take your head and try to look over your shoulder, it's going to elongate your torso, causing your shoulders to droop and causing you to go and just have a really bad time. So, when you're doing this exercise and you're training anything off snow, head positioning is going to be absolutely crucial. So, your head should be positioned at the ground under your armpit.

      "fullText": "in this video I'm going to completely change how you look at jumping in the [Music] park and in order to go and change your POP so you can really go and start boosting up with maximum control and just getting the air like a pro snowboarder we're going to do this with something called popping that's when you fully utilize the tail of your snowboard in a way that doesn't hyp extend your body letting you stay contact and control and this is how you can go and get the nice shifties and just really feel relaxed and your snowboard first let's address a biggest confusion when it comes to popping and that is how it differs from an ollie an ollie relies on using your full tail my to go and spring off a jump so your spring point is actually the tail of your snowboard instead of the lip of a jump and this is why haing is perfect for small jumps but it becomes less beneficial once the jumps have more kick and give you more options but if I want to alllie something that has like no takeoff like this box that's the perfect place to use it the difference of a pop is you're relying on snapping off the Jump building tension by pushing through your board and that makes you snap off so instead of trying to all I'm snapping and that's why it doesn't really work on a bump like this because there's nothing to snap me off so when it's something like this we want to go and pop off that tail we're generating that pop through our snowboard and that's how we're getting that heght but when we're popping off a jump we're going in pushing through pushing into the snow into our snowboard goes and snaps off that lifp getting that snap feeling so that's the difference between alling and popping Alles are requiring to snap off your board get that spring off the board where pop you're pushing off of it and relying on the angle of the feature to pop you into the air so the way to think about popping isn't trying to go up and trying to lift yourself extend because that loses tension in your core we're trying to go and push through so we can keep that little bit of Bend and keep drien so for something like this we're going to go and try to drive our waight into our tail and that's going to go and naturally lift us off and snap while using the full length of the snowboard a really important part of the puff is your upper body positioning if you just go and try to pop off your tail of keeping your upper body you're going to land tail heavy every time and this is where the rock motion comes in we want to keep our core engaged and centered over board and as we go and off over we're going and bringing our upper body back to Center so it sort of looks like this as we go and squat down you put pressure into a board you lean to the back foot and then as you go and extend up you come back to Center so it's back foot extend up back to Center and that's what pulls you back in line with the jumps because jumps are angled you need to go and pull your body into it you can think of this a lot like rolling a roller you're coming up and you're trying roll over Pump It Roll It Pump It Roll It and we comp this with the angle of our upper body when we're riding we need to make sure our upper body is set over our toes and that way when we go and pop and do this rock motion we're keeping that Center Mass over the balls of our feet and that's what lets us pop up we're keeping our core engaged if you go and pop up without going keeping yourself stacked over you're going to lose that control and that micro so we want to be over and bring our legs up to us that's the key to being in control in the air you want to hold that stack position on one the in run through the transition and pop up and as you lift your legs up you stay with your balance set on that point so my body set over this point and I have full range of motion through here this is all adjusted and then we use this to pop up and bring it in lifting those legs keep that same C of balance for a little roller here we can just go off the tail slightly and see how that goes and gives me a bit of air time we don't even need to pop that hard with the legs just keeping that tail content will push you up and then if we do want more snap we can go up and all and that'll give us control so how I like to think of it it's like pumping a roller you're coming into the rollers keeping your weight sent over your board so you can go rock up and over up and over up and over and then we can add a little pop to that up and over getting up and coming down and that is the range of motion we're trying to fully utilize and maximize on every pop on smaller features you can go and just use a little bit of tail pressure and rock through that motion while shifting your upper body and it'll keep you in control so you don't need the biggest pop the biggest motion to fully utilize this motion and that's because your tail really does a lot for extending how much height you're going to get just by hting off a tail it can easily Gap back to flat and then as I add a little power to it that's how we start going and ping the biggest issue people have when trying to pop is trying to rush a motion and bring your legs up to them to get that extra bit of height you really need to go and make sure that you're fully popping off that tail and letting the pop off your tail be the thing that brings you up this usually happens when people try bring into the grab lifting your legs to them but this is cutting your motion short limiting your potential this is also true for spins if you just go and try to jump right into a spin it's not going to give you much height or much movement but if you go and try to fully utilize your tail it's going to really let you pop off and get Max Control just by going and maximizing the time your boards making contact with the slope you're able to go and get so much more power that'll let you go and get more control over your Maneuvers and more height off your snowboard cing isn't just any one thing you can do it on a full range of motion your full range of motion is used so what your pop looks like is going to vary but you want to make sure you're not coming in to crouch down because that's going to make it so it's tough to explode a smaller motion is easier to project and easier to control so we're trying to use the biggest motion we can will stay powerful and making sure to get that full snap off the lifp because that's going to actually bring our legs up to us getting us that extra bit of height control that lets us grab it's really important to not try to rush into your grab let it come up to you because this lets you go and see if you're in control so if I'm grabbing I'm popping up and I'm in control then I'm hitting the grab I don't want to try Rush fish motion because that's going to make it tougher if I try to rush into like a nose grab it's going to make me land very tail heavy so go focus on getting your comfortable range motion Max pop then hitting the grab and that will give you the maass control and power off to every pop and if you want more you can now e the ollie in order to get that little extra bit of snap off your board you can all off of any jumps it's just hard to time and hard to control and that's generally why we use C while snowboarding so give it a go try it out because it's going to really increase your control and power off every single feature in the park",

And this is why I can't go and rotate all the way through to a clean five because again I'm on the wrong axis of rotation for the 540. So I'm finishing off 360. And see how I'm very tail heavy. So I'm needing to go and try correct my axis rotation. And I am landing completely 90. If I went and rotated 540 from here, I would have landed very tail heavy, very uh bad upper body position, I probably would have slammed. So, the tilt in the shoulders here is what's stopping me from getting this 540. And this is something you're going to see a lot in my riding and a lot in people's riding still learning. It's just these slight imperfections off the takeoff. So, this dip in the shoulders combined with a leaned back motion that we saw in the front three earlier is why I'm not able to front side 540. And with that takeoff, I'd never be able to go and get a proper front side 540. This back free is a little bit better, but we can see I'm still holding that bend in my legs. I think a lot of this has to do with catching my heel edge when I was younger and like not being confident in holding this tall position. So, I used to pre- spin on my backside spins when I was younger, and I'd make it so I'd clip my heel edge. A way you can avoid clipping your heel edge every time is by maintaining bend in your legs. But if you maintain bend in your legs, your upper body needs to go forward. So, this is like a scared safety body position. I'm maintaining a bend so I can maintain toe pressure, but because of this, I'm not tall. I'm not generating power straight up. Let's go and imagine trying to throw power into this position. Where's your weight going to go? It's going to go straight down towards the ground. So, if I threw like a backside seven from this position, I'd be going straight misty flip and I wouldn't be able to come anywhere close to getting the proper axis of rotation.",

Here we have a positive positive stance. So that means both bindings are angled towards the downhill slope. This is really good for having your hips open, allowing you to go and perform harsher turns, getting more leverage of your hips. And this is going to let you go and get your hips lower down and just start driving in weight into those turns with less effort.

      "fullText": "this video we're going to explain the why behind backside setup carves you see a lot of videos on the internet explaining how to do a backside setup carve but not actually giving you the reasons why you're doing the things you're supposed to be doing I'm a strong believer that you need to understand what you're doing so you can go and change it make adjustments especially on something as complex as a backside setup carve that's fundamental for your whole spin it's really important to know why you're doing something so you can go and adjust it to the feature or to the trick so that's what we're going to be doing in this video so first why do we set up carve the main reasons are to avoid drift get good Edge pressure and to go and set your upper body up in a position that you can generate a lot of power but this happens through a few different ways the first is your heel side approach every backside setup carve involves you going heel side to toe side and this is actually a really important part of the trick because it's going to do a lot to open your hips and position you this happens because as you're coming into a jump you want to have your hips opened towards the far right corner the reason why we're doing this is because it's giving us a good platform to go and shift to our toe Edge so if we go and take a second to look at this Frame you'll see that right now my whole board is angled towards the right corner my chest is open towards that corner and this is exactly what you want if you're coming straight into the jump at this point it's going to make it so when you shift edges it's going to put you on a slight angle it's going to make you start drifting and start closing your shoulder where if you go and come in with your hips slightly open towards that back corner it lets you go and transition to your toe Edge and that little bit of shift of momentum and transitioning makes it so instead of being angled towards the corner you're now angled straight allowing you to hold that straight line through the whole takeoff and the opening the chest has another massive benefit and this gets bigger the bigger the spins you do but this applies for back ones back frees every single backside Spin and that is approaching the jump with your chest open if you don't go and initiate opening your chest with this heelside pressure you won't be able to hold a opened up chest position on the toe Edge for a long period of time because this position right here is actually a bit of a compromised position you're putting a lot of twist in your hips you're putting a lot of tallness in the upper body and that's going to put a lot of torsion onto your toe Edge so we can't actually hold this spent position for a really long time and that's where the timing of the Heel To Toe Edge comes into play because we want to make sure that our chest is open until we go and start snapping or spin so for this back free you can see that I'm coming in chest open when I'm around a board length away from the takeoff this makes it so I can go and snap my spin generate power without overextending my upper body allowing me to go and leave off for the backside 360 with my upper body almost paral parallel with my snowboard and this is exactly what you want if you let your upper body start to really go and lead the rotation around it's going to make it so your legs have to play catch up so a good setup carve puts you on the right amount of power that'll let you go and close off nice and patient allowing to keep your vision relatively in line and that's going to carry through for a full spin so for the timing for the setup car more heal pressure for longer the better so here you can see that I'm getting on my heels early and I'm holding it for a pretty large duration of time and when I'm doing this I'm also trying to not Traverse too far across the slope if you go and try catch yourself traversing all the way across the slope it's going to give you a lot of sideways momentum so for example if we go super angled here and then try to cut back it's going to have a very sway Motion in the hips uh we'll just play this quick and watch my hips because when you're doing the carve and you switch from your heels to toes it shifts your hips so that's why we want to go and keep everything stacked and aligned because that's going to keep our upper body over top of our snowboard and having your upper body over top of your snowboard makes it so when you go and shift from your heel Edge to your toe Edge it's a very minimal motion and your weight's going to be centered over your board through the full duration where if we tried to do a more aggressive heelside carve is going to make it so our feet end up coming further away from us because that's the only way to get more pressure right to go and load up more weight and start leaning back more so that's going to make it so our feet would be around here and as we go and shift that upper body into the toe Edge it makes it so the feet would have to travel further across the slope and that's why when we're trying to do this heelside approach you want to be super nice and stacked trying to stay as much over your board as you can and the only way you can go and get this extra pressure is through Bend in the leg uh this doesn't look like much Bend but it's way more than I was using before and it's been helping so much now let's talk a little bit about the transfer and why we're switching edges uh we'll use a different clip because that one's a bit played out we have a back seven here and we'll go and use this one to go and explain why we're Edge changing when we're Edge changing so you're Edge changing to try time yourself up with the takeoff to make sure you don't Dr rift this is going to change a little bit from smaller jumps to bigger jumps and that's because when you're changing edges isn't as much about the positioning on the feature instead it's more about how much time you need to spend on your tow Edge so if you're hitting a little jump but you need to hit really fast you'll be able to get onto your tow Edge a lot sooner because you'll be spending less time on it but if you're hitting like a big jump but you're hitting relatively slow you'll want to delay getting onto that tow Edge because the longer you're in your tow Edge the more you're going to start leaning forward and breaking at the waist making it hard to keep this tall posture that's really important on every spin so let's rewind it a bit here so here you can see I'm doing a couple of things first of all I'm traversing myself across the slope trying to make sure that I'm aligned with the far left corner of the jump that's because I don't want to be coming in on an angle this way because if I'm coming on an angle here I'll need to do a more exaggerated angle around to try to get on my tow Edge where if I come in all the way on the right side I can just hold a nice constant heel Edge pressure allowing me to get a more smooth transition to the toe Edge so that's why whenever I'm trying to do a setup carve if I'm hitting like two jumps I'm trying to Traverse to The Far Side of a jump so that way I don't need to do as last minute of a setup carve and can just hold that straight long line on the heels and then the timing here is usually going to be through the spoon of a jump so you can see I'm super pressured I'm trying to hit flat base right here at the spoon of the jump the reason why you want to be flat based here is because this is going to be where you're hitting the most G's so if you're on your toe Edge it's going to really want to break you forward and collapse you up the waist so we're trying to hit this little period of flat Bess it also helps because it helps you carry that angle of your board if you immediately go and try to switch from heel Edge to tow Edge it's going to go and actually have a lot of momentum so you can see here I get a little bit bucked this is telling me about I went and got into my angle a little bit too late making it so I have a lot of momentum and look at how my legs really shift from the left to Center so even bis is only a slight mistake it's still causing my lower body to go and wish wash very drastically and you want to try to get as little that as possible you watch Mark McMorris you watch with pros and very going to have as little of that as physically possible so I'm transitioning right through spoon trying to hold that flat base because that flat base little bit of hold time is going to make it so you're not going and continuing that wish wash momentum you're adding a little bit of pause a little bit of halt to it so it's a very brief you can see I'm holding it for like two frames but just having that millisecond of flat Bess really really helps for those reasons and then for windup I'm trying to keep my whole body completely stacked with that chest open towards the corner until I start shifting to my tow Edge and as you load your weight on your toe Edge that's when you want to start winding up this is because your hips are open here your toes are gripping engaging and that's giving you enough traction to actually get those hips open get that chest open if you try to wind up like completely flat base it's going to make you unstable get you sort of feeling wacky so the key to wind ups here is waiting to do your wind up until you start getting onto your tow Edge the least amount of time you need to hold this position the better because it's a really hard position to hold so as soon as I go and get into my maximum W up position I'm not staying in it instead as soon as I hit that maximum I'm holding it for like I don't know a frame or two but I immediately start throwing the spin after the fact and you can see here that I'm slightly dipped not completely tall but bat actually okay uh we're trying to be called Paul but having that little bit of lean forward will actually put you on a little bit of an axis rotation that will work for like most things but generally we're trying to leave off a takeoff as tall as possible and the last thing we're going to talk about here is timing and bringing everything together because this spin right here I have to let my upper body lead the rotation a lot more than I did for a 360 on the 360 is taking off pretty much straight you can actually go show that quick uh on the back three here we were taking off leaving off a tail chest hardly rotated but on a bigger spin like a seven you're generating more power the more power you go and generate the easier it will be actually to bring everything back Al line but what we're trying to make sure to do here is time the takeoff so you're continuing your sideways throw throughout the full duration of the spin so if I was in this position here the max snap position but my board was still taking off the snow to things that would happen first my board would have to either pre-spin lose that edge in order to let this momentum come or I'd have to stop that momentum in order to not go and pre-spin off the Jump and this is where the timing of the snap becomes really important it's not so important that you hit the perfect this isn't like the perfect amount of snap the perfect amount of wind up you know but what it is hitting is it's continuing to keep my upper body momentum through the full duration of the takeoff and that's really important I like you think of a drill analogy as the drill is going it's super powerful but as soon as you let go of that button it completely stops and it's has no more power so if you go and finish your snap early on a jump and then you try to hold that position there's no torsion there's no rotational Force so you're not going to be able to generate speed so even if the drill is going slow as long as it's going in a slow constant speed as it snaps off a lip that's going to give you a lot more power than a drill that goes fast and stops and then tries to go fast again so that's a really important thing when you're thinking about this timing for your snaps is you need to try time your snap so you're continuing the throw with your upper body continuing that motion as you snap off the lip that's going to go and keep everything tight keep everything connected and the last thing we're going to talk about here for this backside setup carve we'll get more in depth talking about the mistakes exactly what to do in a future video but this is just why we're trying to do stuff is first we're trying to flatten out our toe Edge so you can see that I'm coming with toe pressure and as I actually wind up and snap I'm letting my board flatten off this is because even if you have the best straightest takeoff in the world if you have too much tow pressure going off the takeoff is going to go and make it so as you pop off your momentum is going to be set forward so here you can see that I have a slight bit of lean and if I go and pop off the edge off the tow edge here Here With That Lean is going to cause me to drift and I had this big problem when I was doing du back 10 and I was rounding over at tow Edge so even if I had a straight line I'd drift a lot and that's why we're trying to keep our board a little bit flatter on the takeoff so more of our power is used to push us up instead of across the slope and the last thing that really helps with this is making sure you don't rush your grab here I'm doing a full snap before reaching into the grab and that's because if if you try to grab too soon bring your upper body down to your grab it's going to make you lean forward and compromise your form and we're trying to keep that tall extended core with that spine because that's going to give us a better Power Platform to go and rotate off okay we actually need to talk about this I'm sorry if this video is dragging on a bit uh I'll make this quick the reason why we want to be so tall is because that makes it so when we throw all our momentum is generated into sideways momentum where if I was like say I was doing my Max snap here and not extending B make it so when I did the snap across my body it'd be angled putting me on a core so the taller you are the more power you can put into your snap well staying flat but the more hunched over lean forward you are even if it's just a lean on that edge the more power you put in that's going to go and throw you downwards so that's why as we're snapping we're also extending getting ourselves taller just lengthening that body because it's going to make it so more power is used sideways and we'll go and play this for and just give you show you a couple examples of the grabbing so now that we have all this in place just watch these videos think about the backside turn the tow Edge transition the timing of the snap all the good jazz that really makes a backside spin successful so here winding up snapping slow on the wrong part I'm sorry about that but this has been a massive game changer for me and I used to think like you don't really need a backside setup carve I was just doing a heels to toes transition but extending that backside setup carve getting those hips open getting that angle gives you such an awesome platform to generate V spins off of and it's really been the biggest game changer of my riding I was drifting so so much last year but now I've been really hardly drifting at all it's all coming from that change of adding that little bit of extra heel pressure to open up my hips giving me that powerful platform to transition wind up and snap so backside wind ups a complex issue there's a lot of components you can't really work at it all at one time but understanding why you're drifting if you're drifting from hunching at the waist from going getting on your tow Edge too soon is going to really help you go and narrow in your training narrow in your riding so my recommendation is get some videos of your setup carve break it down compare them to the setup cars in this video Mark McMorris whoever and see what differences there are because I guarantee you there's going to be some really big ones that are going to be a massive key to improving your riding uh I hope you guys like the video I'm planning on doing one of these for front side spins and we'll be going more in depth in snowboarding my goal with this Channel right now is to just get all the information out there so people can go and streamline their training I have some more plans for future content but for now we're just going to go and get these fundamental principles out of the way right thanks for watching and yeah we'll see you in the next one",

      "fullText": "And this is all best done with your weight slightly shift to the back foot. And then when you transition from your toe edge, heel edge, close off, snap, trying to feel like your maximum range of motion is at this 90 snap. By keeping the proper hinge in your upper body, not only will it make it so your rotation set over your toes, make it so you can't over snap, but it'll also make it so your spot is naturally there. So, from this point, all we need you to do is pop, keep our back front arm leading the rotation, and keep our head steady, and we'll be able to do a really fantastic front side 360. So, with all that in mind, here's a recap on a front side 360 that, if I'm being honest, isn't perfect. But, we're not looking for perfect. We're looking for a good enough spectrum that lets us land no matter what. So, we're coming in, adding that hinge in the upper body, preemptively adding bend into my legs when I'm still in the toe edge, waiting until I'm on my heel edge into closing off a little bit early, you might notice. And then I'm snapping, maintaining the same upper body hinge, making sure to not extend out of it, keeping my spot forward, leading with the front hand, and continuing the rotation. Here you'll see that I'm actually going a little bit big. And once you get really good at this, because the position's so stocked, so solid, you can just let your spot continue going downhill. And that's how you get those front-facing landings. So for everyone at home, remember, find that upper body hinge that lets you go and rotate without overextending and then work your movements through it. And once you can do that, just make sure that you're not going and hitting your wind up too soon and you're really delaying your setup carve. The more patient you can be, the less likely you are to go and stop your motion or over snap. Because when we have a limited motion, it's going to be really tricky.",

hopefully glean some of his techniques and bring it into our own riding and increasing our style and hopefully making us ride a little bit more like him because those tweaks those pops absolutely money let's go and get right into it starting with this massive front free so this front free that he's doing is really interesting because he's using a stalish grab and this has a lot of uh changes it does to your front side 360 it really goes and speeds up your spin as you go and kick out your legs into that stalish grab position this lets you go and get a lot of tweak but it also makes it so you don't need to snap very hard so let's see how he's going and approaching this first the side hit is massive huge jump massive lip so you're going need to be really ready and controlled and the thing he's doing here that's really interesting is look at his arm position he's throwing his spin early and holding this fully spun position so he's actually not generating almost any rotational energy we can just see like a little bit of Leaning open with the hips but he's not actually snapping this with any rotational Force this is because the stale fish goes and utilizes counter rotation right off at the start of the spin and because of this it really goes and speeds it up and it sort of whips you going so if you try to do a front side 360 normally and add a stalefish grab with that poke you're going to over rotate to 540 pretty much every single time uh cheat way to go and do a 540 you usually land heel heavy but Pro tip the next thing he's doing is because he doesn't need to worry about rotation he's making sure he gets the best snap possible by maintaining the same angle as the takeoff the whole way up the lip and maintaining that tail pressure see always is board is making contact the whole time on the lip this is increasing his control and increasing his height by a substantial amount so we can really see it here his whole board is angled and you might notice something his body's leaned back and he's taking over that back foot this is possible because of the tweak and axis of rotation as he tweaks his legs out it's going in first speeding up his rotation second stalling out his maximum rotation force and third it's going and kicking his legs up to him this is making it so he's doing like the perfect amount of cork you want to be doing on a front free where your head's down board's angled but you're not going over your head if you go and start to flipping more than this on a front side 360 it's going to be really hard to control the rotation because you're going to be doing more of a flip axis and another really interesting thing here is look at how early he finishes the front side 360 he's still halfway in the air but he's already spun the full 360 so how does he not over rotate this and that's with counter rotation again he lets his upper body come and pull forward so see how his chest is landing completely forward like this this isn't to brace for the landing or because he's seeing where he's going well yes his head's looking forward because he need to be looking forward to land a front side 360 on a feature like this the reason why there's so much rotation here is because he needed to let his upper body keep rotating so his legs could go and stay uh rotated at 360 so let's go and take a look at this with that in mind so he lets go of the grab pretty much rotated completely 360 he needs to rotate a bit more than 360 because it's an angled riding so he is around 30° more rotation and as he goes and lets go of a grab he lets his upper body come forward this Forward Motion when you go and rotate your upper body one way your legs will need to rotate the other way to compensate that's how counter rotation works so he's using this to go andall out his rotation going and holding the legs here and letting that upper body continue that momentum I wish we had 120 frames per second here because it would be so sick to see it with every frame but that's the technique he's using he's using a strong pop on that front threee going and hitting the grab and then he's going and using counter rotation to control the rotation making sure he doesn't over rotate a very good way to approach a front side 360 on a massive feature where you're trying to not go and overdo it uh now we got us pivot to this massive Shifty and the crazy part about this C clip is the landing this Landing is less than a board length and he's going so high uh I don't know how high this is definitely over 15 ft though like this is is massive so how is he going and getting this kind of precision and this kind of control on this big of a jump first let's take a look at the lip so the lip here isn't nearly as kick oops sorry the lip here isn't nearly as kicky as the last one and we can tell that because look at the angle of his board coming off Kevin back Storm's a good enough Rider that he won't have his nose coming on a higher angle or lower angle when he's trying to do a standard pop off a jump his board will Flex up if he does something like an Olli but for features like this you're trying to keep your board in a straight line and strong this is because you get way more power just going and pushing pressure for your board but you will trying to get it to flex up so by keeping it strong and keeping it sturdy and keeping it in contact that's how you're getting controlled power because as soon as you start letting that board Flex it's going to make it so your pop point is now based on your board position and not the end of the lip making it hard to control so that's what first thing is doing is making sure he's maintaining contact this one you can see that he's still weighted over his back foot to maintain that tail pressure off the lip but he's shifting his upper body back forward when you go and maintain tail pressure like this you need to have your hips slightly shift back in order to keep that tail in contact and then to counter that we' go and pull the upper body forward and that makes it so your Center and mass is still set over the center of your board so you can do all this twisting coming up more forward of upper body but you need to make sure that you're not overdoing it and you're keeping your weight still centered next his chest is opening his chest is opening right here for a very particular reason and that is trying to go and preemptively angle his upper body inch a landing if he took off completely squared here what would happen is he'd land very tow heavy into that Landing because his board wouldn't rotate or he want have his weight naturally shift over enough so he's doing that to preemptively put the angle and he's also doing a Shifty but watch this for the Shifty oh he actually hits a grab and does a little Andy Shifty here pretty sick but before shifting even though his chest is open here he pulls his chest back to neutral and then pushes it out on cha shiy really emphasizing the importance of waiting to Shifty his chest is open it'd be really easy to pop a Shifty here but he doesn't because if I had less in control instead he fully pops up gets on the angle he wants to be on pulls back to a neutral position then grabs then Shifty it out and even though this is a big jump you want to be doing this process on every single jump this is a big reason why he can get so stylish on these grabs because at this point here he's completely in control he can go and grab tweak however he wants because he doesn't need to really readjust so he pulls back and look at his upper body not shifting at all so this whole jump was 100% success he could do anything he wanted right after this point right here he's back neutral he's on the Arc of a jump pulling back into a landing so he can just grab Shifty out and just be in completely in control and that's where a lot of his style comes from it's just that finesse that control off a lip that lets you go and really get styly so this one he gets a little more loose a little more arm flil so let's see why that is let's see if we can go and Coach Kevin borm here how he could go and get this a little more stylish with less arm flare well I think it's more indication that still arms isn't necessary the only determining factor in a sick clip so he's riding with his chest open this is a good riding position and you'll see a lot of people riding like this let's see if he's Landing heal heavy or anything to go on counter thatat no he's okay a little bit so see how this jump sort of angling to a heal Edge so this is telling me that he's going and preemptively opening his upper body again just to go and get preemptively into that angle so see how his chest is open towards that jump he's landing and then he's already in that position because he needs to hold that position for the pop and this one he's popping up his chest open and immediately doing the Shifty completely going against everything I said in the last clip so let's see why that is really quick so his chest is open here completely and he goes and rotates into Shifty as the same time he pulls up his legs or the other one he went and waited into after hit the grab so this is why he's able to go and get the grab sooner get a more consistent tweak but it's also why he's needing to go and shift a little bit more to rebalance so see right here his body weight is set slightly over the heel Edge and it's not quite as over the toes and that's why he's doing a little bit of an arm Circle and Landing a little bit not in control it's also because it looks like it's a very sloped Landing here so he might be doing this on purpose in order to go and hit that Landing slope a little bit better this one's a little hard to tell because we can't see the landing angles but what I think this shows is you can go and preemptively have your chest open to do a Shifty but it does make it a little bit more technical so here he has a very narrow Landing he has a very important purpose of like a position he needs to be on the next one so he's not worrying as much about getting a strong pop see how his legs are staying a little bit of bent bent in V torso he's not fully extending he's not getting back full pop and if you don't fully pop it's really hard to get maximum control so that's why he's needing to rebalance a little bit in the air here that's his arm spling that's making it so as board's coming back in and then as he lands he pulls straight into that heal Edge position and then since he's already turning heel side and he's going sort of to the left he's mashing that momentum and using it to go into C that Shifty and when he's Landing to a bank here not but landing's probably perfect Kevin I'm I'm sorry for ever doubting you for even a millisecond so here just a massive front side 180 uh let's go and break this down a little bit because this is a really cool way to go and see how people actually do 180s at like a high level if you don't know front side 180s are one of the least done tricks in snowboarding I haven't done one off of like a bigger than a 10- foot jump so if you pull out a front side 180 and it's legit like this one people are going to be stoked so first he's taking off a lot like his uh Shifty V in the last video with chest preemptively opened and he's holding that open position so he's not really generating much rotational energy just enough to make sure that he's like rotating enough for that Shifty from there he's using well from there he's just holding that Shifty position but this is working right now because look at both of his arm positions for both angle towards the tail of his snowboard normally if you're counter rotating you want to have your arms like cross the other way because you're trying to pull it back but instead he's pulling them towards the same side he's rotating so that's making it so if this little bit shiy momentum is carrying him around for the spin but it's not enough to get the full spin around and that's where he's utilizing counter rotation again so because his arms are over here and he's only rotated around 90 he has 90 more to rotate so what does he do he goes and pulls his arms back across his body see how his arms are now pointing this way so his arms are pointing over here pulls him back across the body finishing rotation with his snowboard because this front one's on a side hit so hard to control he deemed that it's not very smart to try rotate it like a spin so instead he's using a Shifty continuing the rotation of the arms and then going and using another Shifty to finish the spin off so this is basically a double Shifty or continuation Shifty uh or maybe just a delayed stalled out like front side Shifty 180 where he went and just didn't go and use that counter rotation into very late and probably one of the sickest front ones ever done maybe the sickest front one uh let me know in the comments if you know a sicker one but that one one is going to be hard to beat here he's doing a front side Rodeo 5 and front side Rodeo fives are a really cool trick that I'm looking forward to going talking about a little bit here I haven't actually done this one on snow but I tried a few in the bag in Japan and they make a lot of sense but I'm scared going upside down so have not committed so first let's look at the takeoff wow so look at how sturdy and straight he's staying on his takeoff I learned that you can do this trick if you have your upper body complet completely hinged forward and when you're throwing your upper body down it does the trick but Kevin back Storm's here from Max pop Max Control and if you throw down if your body collapsed it's going to really absorb a lot of that takeoff so what does Kevin back storm do he goes and holds his strong tall poster and goes and rotates his shoulder down towards his foot so we're doing the same thing but he's making sure to go and wait to drop his upper body into that position until after he takes off that's actually something I'm going to have to try out in my own writing that's really cool because that's the problem I've been having with like these flips and stuff off the lips is I know the positions you want to be in with the body but I usually enter them too soon because I'm nervous so Kevin btor just really showing the benefits of being patient getting that takeoff and trusting that that upper body position works even if you're not in it in the maximum extended way from there this Trick's complete he's done you're blind for a little bit like you would before a wildcat but you just pull around and at this point you have no rotation on this trick but the difference with having your shoulder throw down like that is your chest is open your back arms pulling because of this you'll be able to use counter rotation again so see how he's like just in a really bad Wildcat axis here but his upper body is rotated and that's letting him go and pull his legs around counter rotation style so you're seeing a trend in this video part and it's that he's really liking this front side Shifty takeoff really liking to utilize counter rotation in snowboarding and that's what you'll find with a lot of these Pro snowboarders and every over in general people have things we're good at and things that they're going and working on and you want to go and emphasize those points when trying to film a video part like this because you're just trying to make the best part possible so you're going to do the things that you're absolutely best at and Kevin borm is one of the best stylish counter rotation so here uh one sec is this switch or regular I have to go back and check I'm bad with people's foot positioning so this is for sure regular right let's go back to Mr STS quick yeah so he's regular footed I think know what doesn't matter if it's hard to tell if he's Pros if you're switch or goofy uh anyways back one he's doing a lot like a switch back one which is why I was sort of bringing it up but this back one is really cool see how he's going and popping off up the the tail again emphasizing that takeoff again emphasizing keeping the shoulders and let's go and talk about this a little bit backside 180s are really important to not have your upper body rotate too much because you need to keep your spot down under you so see how his head is sort of leaned over with his upper body this is letting him spot all the way under and watch how that will go and track throughout the rotation so as he goes and travels forward his head is staying in that position so even though his upper body's rotating a little bit more his head's hardly moved at all and this is really crucial on one 80s 360s every trick minimal head positions ideal so for this trick he's not even worrying about rotating instead he's just having his upper body rotate and continue that rotation oh like that's so sick and from there his body's rotated completely 180 maximum and he's on the perfect Arc of a jump coming to The Landing so what does he have to do he just counter rotates and look at how his body just rotates around his spot this is why this Trick's so sick and this would probably be pretty consistent for him because of that spot oh so cool uh all right so he's coming in head spotted down here and instead of having the head rotate looking around the shoulders looking trying to move it instead he just goes and keeps it down there and pulls it even more and he can just see the whole way it's like he's not even doing a blind trick and when he lands looking forward uh you can land looking forward on stuff like backside 180s if you go and spot them this way preemptively rotating the upper body even utilizing counter rotation uh but if you're trying to spin them normal with rotation you really want to use that blind Landing to kill that rotational momentum here another Shifty stylish cool oh let's break down this pow Landing a little bit we already know quite a bit about with Shifty at this point so how's he Landing in pal first he's staying crouched up into right before he's meaning the lip and see how he's not holding a straight leg position he's only straightening out as soon as he's making contact this is going to be more powerful and explosive ideally you're not trying to old extended positions and snowboarding for a long duration of time so as he's coming down he's extending and meeting the snow and what's really important for his pal Landing is look at his positioning first he needs to make sure he's Landing with his nose up to do this he's going and having his hips slightly shift towards that back foot making it so he's Landing a bit tail heavy but to counter this he's going and shifting his upper body forward so this is making it so again his weight is set over the balls of his feet same principle we were using on the takeoffs he's using right here on the land in arms coming up uh I don't think there's any reason why arms coming up is like important here I know it's done a lot I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts on that because I know my arms come up when I land stuff and I'm going big and you're start getting it Free Falling feeling a lot yeah I'm not too sure on that one I'll have to think about it more and this pal is just so deep just absolutely eight so yeah just same takeoff principles on the landing and pal that's pretty cool one less to learn if you can use the same principles on takeoffs and landings here really sick o really sick front s oh and that spot back F way so front SS and power are pretty tricky because you can't really use the constant spot like you would normally so first what does he do he makes sure to not over rotate his upper body and he's going and making sure that Tails maintaining contact as long as possible and he wants a slight bit of cork so he's tilting his whole upper body off AIS slightly B cork spins not really by throwing them up but by tilting your whole body towards the axis you want to be corking on so this takeoff is absolutely perfect and look at his head position nice and forward he's not trying to look around and Rush that spot that spot will come even on smaller jumps so from here he's spotting forward eyes locked on the same point 360 and at this point is where he does something really cool so his spot sort of like changes from being like underneath to like over top here I never done a front seven on this axis so I can't really visualize what that's like but this is just done I think because of the axis rotation that he threw himself on because his board is rotating that rotation is setting him so as he keeps his spot forward uh his body's rotating like on that flip axis but his head is pointed at the same spot here as here uh what this is tell telling me is his head isn't determining his axis rotation at all here and instead he's just going and holding that constant spot and going and letting his body continue that natural axis that he set off the lip of a jump and then from there he's going and utilizing counter rotation at the end why is he using counter rotation because he's rotating 720 he has a lot more rotational energy and because of that he wants to go and slow it down counter rotation while it speeds up your spin it also slows down your maximum rotation velocity and that's why he's coming into the landing with less impact so he's using the blind Landing principles for this see how his head spot here and then it's shifting as he travels past that spot point to there but he's confident that he's using enough counter rotation and he's Landing powder what also helps to kill rotation that he's looking up from the blind Landing early and looking forward but that one he's actually using the blind Landing just like he would in the park just making sure to utilize counter rotation so he can land looking forward a little bit better and then double too 9 uh I'm not qualified to talk about this one I'm sorry I haven't ever done this one and I don't know if I'm planning to anytime soon but basically it's the same motion and then you just pull it so I guess you would throw it less like a flip knowing that you have more rotational energy to bring it around oh so cool and we'll end it off with a backside 360 and this backside 360 is probably the best example that you don't need to rush your grabs in order to get a sick grab so first let's see the in run so this in run and takeoff is more proper than you'd find on more side hits and because of that he can take a more proper jumping position the big thing we can tell from this is see how his hand not dragging the snow he's actually able to keep his torso high enough but he's staying tall enough to not let that hand drag and as he comes off the lip what is he doing he's just going and matching this angle and he's not trying to extend see how he's not popping or anything so he's holding a little bit of edge pressure and just riding off his Edge this is because he doesn't care about his pop this feature is massive and he doesn't care about uh drifting a little bit you don't need to worry about drifting too much if you're not trying to like build up bigger spins it's not as big of a deal in powder especially if you have an open Landing so the thing he is focused on is preemptively positioning his upper body so this position looks bent over weak uh his upper mass is far away from his legs doesn't seem too proper but what happens is as soon as his legs pop up and catch up he's now in the exact same position maybe even a little bit more bent over but now it goes and has a center of balance set so even though he lost this exact center of balance point for a millisecond here and he would have if he held his position too long he would have started digging in and falling over because he only held it for a bit it's okay and he with his position he preemptively set his upper body into the spot he needs to be for the spin what going to let him get so much more control and balance because if you try to go and fully pop up and extend a spin you're going to need to time to pull everything back together pull everything back into control but instead what does he do he goes and pops with his bent down position and this has another sneaky purpose that I just noticed look at where he's spotting because he's going and taking off with his upper body so down it's making it so he can spot underneath his legs aligning him to spot the backside 360 a lot sooner what's so crucial when judging a backside 360 off a big feature then he's just going and making sure that back arm is leading the rotation even on a feature of his big back arms leading the spin coming around and look at how long he waits to grab doesn't go and re Force to grab he's like okay I'm controlling my access rotation controlling my access rotation got it now I grab then he goes and let's go and uses a little bit of counter rotation to finish it off doesn't need much instead Racing for the landing truly amazing snowboarder one of the best guys to watch uh let me know what rever we should cover next I'm loving these videos I'm learning so much while doing them so thanks everyone for the support on this kind of content let me know who I should cover next and yeah have a good one",

      "fullText": "hey shredders this is episode 4 of learning from my mistakes in this video we'll be covering 2015 I was 15 years old and at the start of the season I broke both my arms uh let's go play that clip really quick because that really impacts your season smashing both your arms especially we had a toe rope so that is my first ever broken bones and it wasn't a very pleasant experience uh here's how I broke them both right here wrist guards on early season and just snap them I went and wrote it's worth a pain on the one and not to Broken shred on the other because I'm cool like that uh we'll start with this and break down why this happened because this is one of those dumb mistakes that you make on the planning side and then the execution side so my coaches told me this jump was too small to go and actually do a back five on so I'm like okay we'll do it off a side hit and at this point I was doing my corks by throwing completely down so look at how much I'm snapping and committing to doing this front roll this is making it have a lot of momentum being generated into that downward Arc combine that with a very flat Landing with this Traverse and then some bad wrist positioning and you can almost see the wrist snap right there so snap hit my face really hard and my binds actually got stuck and I couldn't get off my board so it was not a good experience F just goes to show you uh wait until you have a proper jump for a feature don't rush to go do your tricks until you have the proper uh equipment to do them but this besides that this was an amazing year for me I rode 5 days a week and really made good progression here's my first day back jumping with my broken wrist and this is classic you'll be seeing my problem here breaking at the waist throwing down grabbing too soon causing me to under rotate a lot and land heel heavy uh for the back five here you can really see how I'm sort of making do with a breaking net for Waste but it's affecting me so this one I got super corked because I went and broke so much uh the reason why if you break out your waist it corks you is because when you're vling forward it makes it so as you're flowing down your momentum is actually sending you downwards instead of just completely sideways and that's where this little bit of dips coming from so that's a quk but it's an unnatural Quirk and improper the reason why it's improper is look at how it's lining me up to come into the landing my flip to spin ratio is incorrect and that's what you'll get a lot when you go and try to throw your corks down like this I'm pretty sure this one is my actual attempt at the cork no that is a attempt out of backside 720 so this is really interesting because this is my first ever attempt out of back seven and the reason why it doesn't work is because this downward motion doesn't let you go and get full extension in your upper body when you go and throw down towards the ground like this it's going to stop you from going and having that momentum carry through making you just very stiff and very not in a strong position to generate rotation I'm also going and reaching in towards the grab what's going and exaggerating this mistake and that's making me grab close to 180 if you don't know you really want to be grabbing your 720s around here so if I would have grabbed at this 270 position here and being in this position I would have been able to take my arm and pull through the spin and that would help me continue my momentum but because I went and reached down for the grab right away it actually stopped my momentum and made it so I don't have the ability to go and readjust and pull through that second part of the spin and that's making it so instead of going and pulling the spin I'm letting my head sort of drag when you're doing a 720 you need to make sure that your head is leading the rotation so see how I'm looking straight sort of at the camera here that's a great sign that this 720 would never work even with a perfect snap because this head position would need to be right here underneath the arm reaching around round leading the rotation coming to that Landing if you're in a neutral position with your upper body neutral position your legs halfway through your spin on a s it's not going to result in a completed 720 and that's why I need to go and let go and I try to use counter rotation to pull my legs around but the combination of not knowing where I am in the air because I'm not leading the rotation and not leading with my upper body makes it so a counter rotation doesn't work and I'm not able to correct my Axis rotation so this is super far off really really bad takeoff but I would have been able to get close to Landing if I would have grabbed here and let my uper body lead rotation with the eyes that's why you really want to train your rotations by letting that upper body lead and getting used to that because I can't do it on freeze I can't do it on fives so I'm for sure not going to be able to do it on sevens here's another 720 attempt and you can see I'm just not able to go and put much effort into it and that is with that throwing down motion when you're throwing down this much you won't be able to put much power because the more power you put the more it's going to Cork you the more it's going to flip you here we have a front free and this is a very textbook mistake on a front free and it's two things first of all I'm going and Fry my upper body way too soon see how I'm going and finishing this upper body snap position before my tail snaps off the end this is happening for a couple reasons mainly though it's just too early on the timing and when you do this it halts your upper body rotation making it so you're not going to get as much snap I'm okay here because I'm grabbing melon and Melon really speeds up your spin because it goes and leads with that shoulder and then the other mistake I'm doing here is I'm throwing into that grab so see how as I leave off the lip my upper body is already in position to grab you really want to give that full extension before grabbing so that's a big mistake and then this mistake uh I'm making here I actually don't fix into much much later I think like another uh three or so years and that is my spotting at this point I didn't know the actual principles of how you're supposed to Blind land so to spot my front side 360 instead of going and locking my eyes in on the knuckle and holding the spot instead I rotate my spot around my shoulder and that's making it so I continue my spot looking downhill you don't want to be landing a front side 360 completely parallel with the upper body eyes downhill like this because you have too much rotational energy you're not going to be able to stop po it this should be having this arm rotated here eyes looking back at the knuckle chest open here that will go and put my weight over my tow Edge letting me dig in my Edge I'm going to use that upper body rotation top for for spin so we're going to see that a lot out of me I'm going to watch through my heals a lot of my front side spins and it's all because of those two things uh train the constant spot think about it and that'll really help know what this is a little fun one why did I fall on this method on the hip I hips are one of those ones that I see a lot of people struggle with and that's because you need to match up your Arc up with your Arc across if you go to up for across uh it's not going to work so here my issue is I'm going and Landing completely downhill uh what would work if I had a very straight up Arc and straight down uh I should do a little demo so this would work fine if I went completely straight up and then completely straight down because I don't have much sideways momentum but the more you travel across the slope the more you're going need to make it so your Landing is angled the way you're going so since I'm gapping all the way to the half point of a hip here I'd want to come up and land with my board slightly angled continuing that momentum so here I just popped up expecting to be able to land straight back down through a transition sort of like a quarter pipe but because I had so much sideways momentum it made it so as I impact the ground my impact wasn't enough to kill my momentum so my sideways momentum continued and my board wasn't in a position to prepare for that resulting in honestly a really painful ass slam I really didn't like this one uh you know it's about ass slam when it's what eight years later and I'm still salty about it no more than that like 10 years later uh here we got some rails this Trick's pretty cool uh this wasn't on purpose but little freaking ship mute grab to nose tap uh if you haven't tried it nose Taps on Rails you feel like a beast absolute boss uh 360 hand drag [Music] tap uh we'll break down a couple more tricks here I'm not going to let the video get too long this was a very important year for me so we'll probably break this year into two videos but here uh when I'm hitting rails I'm really over popping look at how much I'm over the rail this isn't because I'm trying to Gap it it's just because I'm scared of clipping my Edge and then I'm letting my upper body rotate towards the front knees rotate so this is just not being comfortable being in that square position coming into the heel Edge uh I'm mostly used to getting J that position off of like uh my board slides for the backside of apprach oh was that a sorry it just had you go back for a sec uh so that's just need more time doing backside 50-50s on less gnarly rails here we have a back five on the biggest jump at my local Hill and this one I'm able to go and land because I'm not going and throwing it very hard it's not messing up my Axis rotation very much and here you can see that I'm somewhat doing the blind Landing it's a little bit angled wrong but it puts my upper body into that position that I can ride away but the main reason this rotation is nice and flat not overdone not overzealous with it is just because it's a big jump I'm not throwing very hard so my upper body is super broken at the waist my completely down but because I'm not using much force it's not going in exaggerating this effect letting me get away with it but this is a very broken a waste bad takeoff so it works but it doesn't work very well oh here we actually have a pretty dope back two on uh this was just like one of the ones I hucked but there's a few things here that you could do way better so first thing I want to point out is look at how much better of this takeoff upper body straight leg straight this is just showing that I was was uncomfortable a setup carve and I was scared to do the spins causing me to compromise my form this is a much better snap leaving off a tail but problem is I'm going and blinding myself and leading with upper body a little bit too soon too early and that's my so I can't continue that rotation with my upper body making it so I need to use counter rotation and I'm getting a little caught up on my arm here but isn't going to give you the most control but that was a way better take off than I was doing on any of these jumps and we'll end it with this clip here this backside seven 20 so for of us back seven here uh we landed it we don't count it but why was this one to land when the other ones weren't uh pretty much it's because I missed the grab and it's a way bigger jump so I had more air time to correct myself uh whenever you see arm flails like this that's because you're trying to rebalance yourself in the air arms in control for waving you're not balanced and you need to regain control so here I'm throwing down towards the edge uh but I don't go and hit the grab and this is letting me go and keep my upper body leading the rotation a little bit more not killing as much of that momentum and then instead of going and having my head hold positions at the camera instead I'm going and twirling it around and getting that spot through so this is the right idea you want your head to be pulling leading the rotation like this uh the problem is I had a long period where my head was stopped and then I looked through and that's making it so doing what I like to call a double spot where you spot the landing at one point so here I see the landing you rotate and when you rotate your head around and try spot again this isn't too efficient of a way to spin because you need to delay pulling into your spin in order to go and spot again so you're holding back speeding it up and it's giving you a little bit of blindness and it's making it so you can't pull into a spin lead of your upper body quite as much if you ever find yourself doing a double spot in your tricks unless you're doing something gnarly like a dub 12 or something it's generally going to come from a mistaken form and those combinations bad takeoff uh not continuing the spot and trying to reach for a grab too soon make it so I can hardly get this back seven around we land it uh that's a great boost of confidence but that's not a way that's going to be sustainable and healthy to do that trick so uh we'll end the video here thanks for watching we'll go and continue these throughout the years and yeah let know if you have any feedback but I'm planning on doing more of these I got my laptop back I'm not sick anymore so we're looking good and there's some good content on the horizon thanks for watching and we'll see you next time",

Getting that extension pop off the tail, then counter rotation, but he's adding maximum bend to his body, shifting all the way over to his back leg. And then as he pops, even though he's getting maximum extension, look at how much he's pulling his upper body forward. The more you extend your legs, the more you need to keep your upper body going forward in order to keep that center of balance over the balls of your feet. Because if he bounced up in this angle here, he's going to be slipping out heel heavy. And this makes it so as he brings his legs up, he's able to immediately enter his boardside position seamlessly. And then he has enough sideways momentum so the nose just needs to get over and then it can rock him. And you can see him go and push that foot down. Boom. And this is something you can do when you have this really good position bend in the legs is you can actually move your legs independently. And that's exactly what he's doing here to get this little pop out of clean position. Landing in basically the same position he took offy smexy man. What? Where is he coming from for this hand drag?

      "fullText": "So, the next premotion I do is flattening the base of my snowboard. The reason why we're flattening out the base of our snowboards when we're going and positioning from heel edge to toe edge is because it just increases the size of the turn radius. If you go straight from heels to toes, it's going to go and have a bit of a pendulum effect where your momentum is going to wash you back and forth really aggressively. And that's going to make it so it's way harder to go and control that edge because as your board's momentuming, it's going to have more sideways momentum. Sideways momentum is going to be harder to go and gripping your edge. So, by having a good upper body and then flattening out our base, we're slowing down our sideways momentum and that's going to make it easier to grip in. every turn in every carb in snowboarding, you can think about it like drifting a corner on a car. When you go and hit a corner on a car and you go and hit it with good tires, good traction, you can go and turn at a really high speed without your back tires skidding out and causing you to drift. But if the roads are wet, your tires are run out and then you go and hit the corner with the same amount of speed, you're going to go and start to skid. So that's exactly how snowboarding works. It's a formula of grip versus speed. So the more sideways momentum you have, the more grip you need to have in order to counter it. So this snow here is super perfect, super groomed. So that means I'm going to have a lot of grip, a lot of friction, a lot of traction. Uh, and that traction is going to let me go and dig in my edge more aggressively than normal. These carves like this wouldn't be possible. And if they are, it'd be a lot harder on more icy conditions that you would generally find. This is about as snow as good as the snow gets. So with that in mind, we can go and be a little bit more aggressive with these movements. And we're still going though and trying to maintain these same principles through the whole motion. So heel edge lightening up to the flat edge base.",

And from this stationary position, I can utilize counter rotation. And just pay attention to how subtle my upper body is here. It's coming up, counter rotating, hardly moving at all. Set over that front foot, catching the rail, and then just balancing through. And you can see I'm sliding off a little bit. But because I had enough bend in my legs, enough tilt in my upper body, I can go and shift where my center of balance is, allowing me to maintain contact into the end of a feature. Even when doing something like a front lip gap, we're still keeping the same principles, even though we're trying to generate so much height. So here I'm maintaining tail contact with the lip of the jump as long as possible.",

      "fullText": "I want you to when you're spinning front side 360ies on the spin it as if you're trying to spin hard weight off your toes. This will make it so as you pop and explode, your weight is going to be set over the balls of your feet. This will help fix the other problem of making sure that your spot doesn't go over the shoulder. As soon as we spot over our shoulder, it elongates our core, sets our weight over our heels, and it's going to put us on that offaxis throw. So, we need to make sure that our upper body's pulled over, our weights hyperaggressively set over the balls of our feet. So, I want you to try hold this super over the balls of feet position and try not to extend out of it too much. We're going warm up with just doing a 180 180. And when we're doing this, we're trying to keep our spot set on the center of the trampoline the whole time while keeping our chin centered. So, see here, I'm not looking and pulling my neck this way or this way. Head locked straight down. And as I throw, I'm keeping my head in that stationary position. As we're going and doing these rotations, we're trying to keep our head as stationary as possible. You don't want to be ripping your head as you throw your spin because it's going to elongate you, disconnect you, and make it so you can't see where you're at. So, let's go and do that drill with that in mind. Bend the legs, hinge forward, eyes down, rotate 180, 180. And when we want to start adding more power and more jump, we're going to start extending, but we need to make sure that our final point of extension still has our weight set over here. So, we're rotating like this. See how my upper body is angled forward? Weight set over the balls of feet even as my legs fully extend. And this is going to let us maintain that rotation point, our spot at the center of the trampoline. So, it looks like this. Rotating, spotting through. And we can build this up to bigger spins as well. So for 540s, rotating, coming through.",

      "fullText": "I'm very excited because in this video we're going to cover the most important trick in all of snowboarding, all of trampolining, and that is the backside 360. This trick is so important because we're learning so many fundamentals and it's the building block of so many tricks to come. First things first, you want to make sure that you have the previous steps dialed and that's having the head position here and the ability to use counter rotation. And the biggest problem people have with the backside 360 is two front. First, they'll go and try way over snap it and then they'll have to control it. Pair that with the next mistake that is looking over the shoulder and you have a really hard to control rotation that you won't be able to build off for bigger spins in the future. So, let's focus on how to fix that. The first thing we need to fix is making sure that we're not trying to use too much extension and we're not trying to use too much throw. For backside 360 on a trampoline, we don't need to throw at all. Watch this. I can just pop up, counter rotate, pull it through. It's that simple. If you keep your head position, right core, I don't think I even need to use my arms.",

bucks per day getting ready for day two I'm feeling super good today much more confident the weather's nice and cool but still bright so we're going to go focus on just having some fun on the bags work on per form subconsciously but hopefully get some new tricks some new grabs and just have fun out there day two is the rrap I didn't manage to film midday Recaps because it turns out on the weekends the airbag opens at 11:30 instead of 1:30 so I showed up and like the cars stopped running at 5: so I'm like oh my God I only got three and a half hours to airbag it up so I was just grinding head down lapping and I was like my plan going today I was going to just going steezy not worry about my form just try to get some sick tricks and I got humbled I went for a front free it went okay pretty meth and I was like okay I'll go straight into front 7 washed out like crazy did not work at all and that sort of shook me then the 30 minute break happened I went over to a little kid airbag didn't film this because my phone was up top but I went was like okay I'll do a couple cab under flips because I want to cab dub nine today and then just almost ate on the in run in the air it's hard riding those airbag switch for the first time so that didn't go well but I just had you sort of stewing in thatch and was like okay sort of got me down but I went and bounced bounced back went and did a another front three did a front seven nose grab and I was like okay let's give a front 10 a go front 10 didn't work uh it turns out I was using the wrong kind of wax I was using normal snowboard wax where you need a special airbag kind of wax so I was going too slow so I switched to backside and I had better luck to fat and I just spent the day grinding on my backside principles did a bunch of back freeze working on doing my transition from heels flat base to toes a lot softer staying a lot lighter on the edge and it went well start to get some good back freeze I start to get some really good back sevens and felt really stey a melon grab just building it up and I was just focused on grinding the fundamentals [Music] [Music] and it really worked because then I went to my flatback pens was a trick I struggle with and they were going really well I was feeling really good on the flatback tens throwing them nice and then coming in and Landing pretty decent a little heel heavy still I got to work on that and I decided to go for the flat back 12 and in the air felt really good saw the landing went to stomp it and then as I stomped it I slamed my shoulder into the airbag and it clicked really bad so that was an instance where like a trick that I normally would have landed uh I got more hurt on the airbag than I would have at snow because my legs flipped out arm Dig Dug in and then it just snapped back into place so what I learned from that is make sure to be prepared for your leg slipping out when you're Landing switch because thinking about it that was my first time Landing like uh switch from a backside spin because I didn't do any back fives any back nines so I got to do that before I do some more back 12s because that wrecked me uh then I went back from there because I was getting pretty tired did some back Sev tried with the Indie grab and learned I do not know how to back of an indie grab that sucks for me uh it just goes in a really lion leading with my back arm for the back seven and I just going to do that with the Indy so if I want to get back to I'm going to go and put in some work and build on back even more but I just did a few more back Brees what I learned from today is first the backside techniques I've been thinking about and trying to implement work going and doing my setup carve earlier and having a longer flat based transition really helped me go and stay light on my Edge open my hips and get more rotation out of them along to generate a lot more power with a lot less drift the other really important thing I learned is my front side takeoffs and cab takeoffs are not good enough to be able to go and do the tricks I want to do on the bag so what I'm going to do about this what I'm going to do about this is I'm going to go and instead of going straight to the big bag uh the next time I ride and trying to do some back 14s back 16s maybe instead I'm going to go and build up my front side spins and my Cal spins so that way when I go to a big bag I'll be prepared and ready to do all my big tricks at once because right now if I showed up to a big bag I don't think my front side and Cab's ready the reason why they're not ready is because I'm way too Edge heavy I'm doing a very aggressive tow Edge shifting to my heel Edge and that's causing my weight to go shift back and it's scuffing me while having my board rotate at an angle what I need to do is focus on keeping my board much straighter up for jump that's going to allow me to go and and shift to my heels will maintain a straight line and loading up staying more stacked over the center of my board because on these airbags you really can't be leaning back because it's just not going to go and give you that power plan for the next day riding is to go fix this front side of takeoff and try to get my cab takeoffs better I'm going to do this by focusing on staying more stacked over my board and relying much less on edge pressure just like I did for the backside spits so this was a very good day I went and got a good back 12 even if I got hurt from it I went and learned a weakness on my backside spins and I learned a way to improve my front side spins so I'm going to go think about this try dial it in and then next day I'm going to go do what I did for my backside spins for my front side spins and then take it all together in a few days and hopefully have an awesome day on the biggest air bag so thanks for joining me again today I'm going to keep on continuing these vlogs keep tracking with my progression uh if you want you can like comment on the video uh helps boost engagement and that boost my endorphins and yeah thanks for watching we'll be back soon cheers I was just getting ready to head down to the communal bath and bathe with some old Japanese men and I figured I'd give you a little room update uh it is filled with snacks and messy I got a bunch of half eaten carrots a bunch of empty drinks food all along the floor um my best purchase so far this bag of seaweed he veryable that was only $4 so there's some perks with a room like this uh the downside is this is messy and I'm scared we're going to come check in the room and I'm going to get in trouble the plus side is I can pick up a snack any direction if I look left I got a snack if I look right I got a snack if I look up still no snack so there's room for improvement but the room is doing solid uh maybe I'll clean her up if I take tomorrow off what do you like about riding the airbags um I think it's pretty good it's like because like when you're Landing um it's like you will like like land like very soft because if you fall you don't have to worry um yeah what's your favorite trick my favorite trick is front threes um um because it's like it's not like um it's pretty fun and it's not too big that like and um it's like the spin is not too big and it's not really like small so it's kind of boring if it's too small like don't like spin too early if you spin too early you'll like um you don't get enough like speed like to go like um very high so sometimes you just like land um not really um like straight",

on Rails but various body positioning and changes you can make in order to make sure a slam like this never affects you again and it's going to go and come mostly in at home training and a little bit of on snow different applications of the techniques you're already using because I can see that you've been thinking about the backboard you have a general idea how to do it but there's a couple mistakes here that are really throwing you off the main thing that's throwing you off here is putting yourself in a compromised position making it so your legs are too straight and you hit the feature of your legs fully extended when you hit the feature of your legs fully extended like this it makes it so you get all the impact through your feet so whever your weight is set is going to be where that impact goes and shifts you so here your weight is set back onto your heels because your legs are too straight and because of that the impact shoots your legs out from under you because your center of Mass isn't set right over the balls of your feet I'm going to do a little demonstration here sorry if I don't have the best setup basically what's happening though is you're going and keeping yourself very open very tall so when you go and pop you're going and extending reaching down with shifting your whole weight and core tall what's going to make it so you can't keep tight and can't keep your weight over the balls your feet the balls of your feet are right here right under the toes and that's exactly where you want to be in your positioning when riding so the reason why we go and keep our chests down and forward is because we're keeping our weight here the more I squat down the more I need to keep my chest forward over my toes in order to counterbalance if you try to squat down completely straight on a snowboard you're going to go lean and fall back so with that in mind let's go and take another look at what's happening here so you're coming into a feature your chest is very open getting preemptively ready for that counter rotation but it's causing this back leg to turn and that's making it so your spine is very straight over your glute here see how straight and tall you are in the spine if we go and compare that to me you can see that I have my chest set over my toes using a bit of counterbalance giving it sort of like this a shape in my torso going and having myself leaned over in order to compensate for that heel side pressure here though because you're going and having your pressure being uh derived from opening your chest it's making it so you don't need to worry about having your chest o go forward so here you just have a straight back putting your weight all the way onto your heel Edge through the whole body and that's what's making it so when you take off you're taking off angled but there's a couple more things happening here but are also leading to a slam the first is you're going and popping and extending your legs as you're jumping for a right on feature like this you really just need to let your tail of your snowboard ride off the feature let your chest stay up a little bit and that will give you plenty of height to get onto it what happens when you go and extend your legs coming on to get more height onto a feature is if you do it too much your legs get to this straight point and the straighter your legs the taller you are the more susceptible you are to this lean so what's happening right now is you're going and putting too much pressure onto your heels because your weight is set too much over stacked with the whole body on the heels and that's making it so when you pop off a takeoff your and Landing a little bit back seat and because you're going and staying Too Tall and not having your chest over your toes it's making it so as you go and impact you don't have the ability to counterbalance this making it so you go and fall completely to that heel side but let's look at this image what would have happened if the your chest positioning instead of here was over here and your legs had a little more Bend then you would have been able to go and rebalance stay centered and ride all the way through and that's why this positioning is so important you want to hold it and try and maintain it through the full range of motion I'm going to go big on me one more time and I'm going to demonstrate how you can train this at home so you never do a fall again so instead of trying to go and pop up and try to extend into your board slide instead work in maintaining this range of motion so find your stack position for me it's around here a little bit my legs and work on opening up and counter rotating all when maintaining that same balance point if you can maintain the same balance point through any range of motion any shift in the hips any dip any increase it's going to give you all the tools you need to stay balanced so this is a stack position this is a stack position this is a stack position this isn't a stack position because I'm Too Tall putting too much weight onto my heel Edge figure out that stack position be patient off that takeoff and it'll make it so the backside 360 I mean sorry backside board slide goes hopefully much much smoother for you resulting in a great success so give it a go and let me know if you need any more feedback have a good one",

And when you're doing this, pull over your body like you're doing a hardway front one. The only reason we're not doing a hard way front one here is because we're using this as a building block trick and also hard way will make it so you can't pre-pin and it's going to induce two-footed jumping more. But if you prefer doing a hardway front one, that's an easy cheat because once it's hard way and you have your weight set over your toes, it'll make it so your axis of rotation and your pivot point is your toe edge.

Next, let's go and cover a few ways that you can go and train this and push your counter rotation. So what is the limit of counter rotation? The limit is generally 180.

      "fullText": "But because Ben's turn radius was off, in order to keep his board straight, he was preemptively jumping his board. So he didn't go and hook and start breaking at the waist. So this is showing big signs of imbalance, making it so he needs to rush the position. That said, he gets a good popup, and there's a lot to really like here about his fundamental air control. First, look at his head position. It's really patient, and his shoulders are relatively squared. The reason why this is such a good sign is a lot of people at this stage are scared to get the 360 around. So, their head will be pulling towards the shoulder and looking over the shoulder or tucking in this way. It's going to throw off your balance because it's going to set your rotation too much over your back foot. So, Ben is doing something here that is really a big reason why he was able to make so much progression and so much control on his back freeze. And that is popping up patient with that upper body, continuing that upper body rotating through. And look at this back arm pulling the whole way. Pulling the back arm like this really helps because it makes it so your chest is rotating, your arm's pulling, and that's going to let your head spot the landing sooner. And the most important thing is with your upper body rotated, you can then pull it back across from you in order to counter rotate to land. And that gives you a lot of control. If you're going and undershooting or overshooting, you can control the speed of your rotation. One of the things that was really throwing Ben off is as he was coming on the fake snow, if he messed up his setup carve, it would sort of mess up his whole takeoff and throw. So that's just showing us that he has a very streamlined system, and if he wasn't falling back completely, it would go and throw him off a little bit. So today, the fixes we were trying to make were increasing the angle of his board, delaying his setup card, so his getting onto his toe edge later, and this should make it so he can increase the range of motion in his upper body. The one thing I want to point out here is even though his upper body is super wound up to the point that I'd say this is maximum wind up he'd want to do. Look at how square his hips are and look at how straight his board is. This is making it so he's not using the biggest rotation. What led us into another problem we faced and that is that he was trying to set the rotation too much with his arms and not enough with his legs. And in order to keep a straight edge, he wasn't able to throw it as early as he needed to. You can see as he's taking off here, his upper body is rotated slightly closed off. This would be really good for like a backside 540, but for a backside 720, we need that upper body to be rotated towards the tail of the snowboard completely 90 almost. And we want the hips to be following. But because he's having this disconnect of his hips not falling and his legs not falling, he's getting this dip position where he's popping up and pushing. And this is where we can really see that problem with that two-foot jump. two-foot jump, legs super straight, disconnecting the core from the lower body. And this is causing a lot of funk. And this is one of the reasons why he's getting so unbalanced and not consistent. Here we can really see that he's trying to go and open up his hips more and get more angle by adding his arm over here, arm over here. We'll talk about this more later, but that's increasing his angle towards the corner. But because he's so he's not dramatic enough with it and not smooth enough with it, he's not giving himself a really strong spin platform. And that's really the biggest thing that you can do to increase consistency on your spins is build that platform. And that's why even though he's working on 720s here, the same things could be worked on on 360s, 5407s, you can just work on more fundamental principles at the same time when you're doing 720s. So that was the focus. But if this was a onso situation, I'd probably have him doing a bunch more backside 360s in order to go and fix this. So let's go and get a good one here. Doop. So you can just see sort of inconsistent. Not really not really it yet. Here we're having some 360s. And I was trying to go and explain to him that we don't want that like tail uh coming up early popping too much, but this was just making it so he was too stiff. And you can see for yourself not really having the same control that we were having on day one. And that's a really normal part of progression. You take a step forward, you take a couple steps back, but fixing these fundamental core principles pay off in the long run. So, it's important to not be scared of making changes because that's one of the main reasons we were able to get Ben to go and accelerate his learning this fast and get his skill level this high in such a short amount of time is he was willing to make any change if it would help his riding. And because of that, we were able to really streamline the process. So here he's getting a little bit more bend in the legs, a little bit more angle. Let's look at his board. Slightly more angle towards the corner of a jump.",

Look at how his weight's completely set over those heels as he comes off a lip. He doesn't try to reenter. So he's riding off a jump. We can see his base coming and his weights just set way too much over those heels. He would have in order to have his legs this straight in this position, he would have had to have his upper body way over here to counterbalance it. But he didn't try to counterbalance with the upper body at all. Just holding that strong position. And because of that, as he came into the snow, he smashed that same angle the whole way.

So, see how he has like a little bit of bend here, but this leg's locked out, and he's going and just rounding to try to keep that center of balance. Uh, this is just making it so he doesn't have any micro control in his legs. And now he's trying to change his momentum too soon, and that's just causing that full clip. And honestly, the worst case scenario. So, how do you avoid this? If he just went and had a bit more bend in this back leg and a little like evened up with this, this fall wouldn't have happened. It's the combination of trying to go into that toe edge turn too soon and having a compromised leg position that made it so he's susceptible to this edge catch. For anyone watching at home, it's almost impossible to edge catch if you actively are riding in a stack position. So, keeping your weight set slightly over the balls of your feet, legs back, hips back. Uh, here I'll draw the little position quick. Do upper body here, legs back here with a little bit of bend like this. Uh, that's a bad drawing. But from that position, you're rocking back and forth. And as long as you don't try to turn too soon for your turn radius and your sideways momentum, it's going to be impossible to catch. But when you go and straighten yourself up this much, you really need to make sure your timing and control is locked in, or else you're going to be really susceptible to catching your edge. So, anyone out there struggling with edge catching, uh, I made a good video on it, and I'll be making some more of this summer, but it's all about your stacked form and making sure that you're not relying on straight-legged leaning too much when riding. Here, this is heel side 50/50 clap, flip over. This happens to the best of us. Uh, heelside 50/50s are a bit of a buzzkill. Um, but basically what's happening here is he's popping too far out of his position. So now his weight is completely set over his heels and that's just making it so he doesn't have any control. If he wanted to do this at this low of a speed, I would have wanted to see a lot more bend in the legs, a lot more bend in the upper body so he could go and pop and get that motion without overextending himself.",

And then what I'm doing here is I'm going and taking my right hand and just pulling it slightly open. Slightly opening the chest, slightly rotating the head. And that's letting me slightly open my hips. So then when I go and make contact with that heel edge, I can instantly go and start locking down. And that's why we're getting this turn radius so quick. And then when going entering the toe edge, what are we doing? The exact opposite. This hand's coming back behind me. My front hand's coming in front, but we're still doing the same process.

      "fullText": "hey shreders this is ep3 of learned from my mistakes in this video we'll be going over my 2014 season I was 14 years old and I was making some serious mistakes that took me a long time to get out of my riding and that's the thing you're going to see in this series is a lot of these mistakes I was making are going to carry over through years I find ways to adapt them shift them that allow me to do bigger tricks but it isn't into much later in my snowboarding but I go back fix these mistakes and been I'm able to really grow as a rider so my big mistake here is this throwing down breaking at a waste motion we're going to start with a 360 and then we'll go on to a 5y 40 attempt and just talk a little about this why this is happening and the benefits the perceived benefits of doing it this way and also the reason why it's such a problem so first what is the problem the problem is a very intense case of breaking at the waste that's where your waist comes and leans forward and you can tell because I'm reaching for the grab before my board has even leave the jump if your arms are anywhere close to your snowboard as you're snapping off the Jump that means your break can't be waste leaning into grab too soon there's a couple reasons why I'm doing this first of all it's a confidence issue if you're not confident you're going to go and not hold that tow Edge start breaking forward forward more and more it's also a technical issue so here the technical mistakes I'm making are getting on my tow Edge too soon winding up uh well not going extending my body my wind up process here doesn't have any extension or hip shift forward so I'm basically going and holding the same approach I was having on my heel Edge but on my toe Edge what's keeping me arked forward even at the very start so this is worse when breaking up the waist this is entering a bent over position and holding it and then the next problem is all deriving from this upper body position my snap I won't be able to use much power much force because if I went and threw down with any force in this motion my momentum sending me down making me go off aess so this whole wind up this whole problem isn't actually giving me any benefit for power up a take off because in this position I'm basically only generating rotation from this arm pulling and Edge pressure now why am I doing this uh this is happening first because I had a bad fall where I clipped my heel edge off a jump caused me to fly backwards land on the knuckle really hurt really shattered my confidence uh so this is a way to guarantee that you never clip your heel Edge because your weight so set over your tow Edge the other reason this is happening is because look at this this form right here is exactly the same upper body position as I use for the duration of my spin so I'm basically feeling uncomfortable coming into the jump and trying to preemptively get into that position uncomfortable because as someone who snowboards and did this trick a lot not knowing what we're doing I knew if I could get to this position I was able to go and land on my feet so that's why it sort of worked for 360s we could get it around but as soon as I go and try to move on to a 540 you start to see the problems and why it won't actually scale to bigger tricks so uh and the reason it won't scale is first you're going through the jump you can see how I'm going and Landing very light on the jump here not much impact into my legs I hardly even need to bend my legs at all this is a great indication if you see this happening in your own writing that you're absorbing the takeoff of a jump and not going up with it very few jumps actually have no impact so if you're hitting a jump and it feels like it has no impact no one else has mentioned that this jump has no impact it's probably because you're not fully popping and it's giving you a smooth transition but it's not giving you height height is so beneficial because it gives you more time to go and spot The Landing you'll be more over top of it it also puts you on a more controllable Arc that will help you go and feel in control in the air and also put you into a more predictable spot of Landing so more Vision more control what's not to like and the other problem with this break H the waste is it limits my power so I'm almost grabbing my board as soon as my tail comes off the end this means this whole wind up this whole snap motion isn't turning Force because I'm snapping but then I'm holding my upper body in this position so let's look at it upper body is here here here so the only rotation I'm actually generating here is fromb Edge pressure and right here this back arm pulling into the spin and uh trying to go and generate rotation this way having your body leaned over like this leads to inbalance in the air what we can see right at this moment where my upper body is completely tilted towards I don't know if that's my back or front foot but completely to Tilted towards my foot and you really want your upper body to always be set stacked over the center reboard you can have your hips tilt a little bit for like a tail grab or nose grab but you're trying to keep your head and your Center MK generally inside the binance of your snowboard this is going to put you on a more controlable of AIS rotation because right now I'm rotating with my upper body over here as my legs are rotating over here so we're getting two different axises where it's all wonky and crooked up here and it's on a flat plane of axis here so you want your whole body on the same plane of axis rotation and you don't want that disconnect between your upper and lower body uh you just won't be able to get power control so breaking up the waste is the main cause of all this it goes in stunts your throw making it so if you have to put Power into your snap it's going to flip you forward that said I was really pushing myself here this was my biggest jump and my goal for today was trying a backside cork five this is it right here uh this was not my first attempt but I want to talk a little bit about my first attempt because I think it's a good story so basically as a bluebird day I did a 360 I did 540 I don't know if I landed them but I do remember about before trying the back Misty 5 I spent a couple hours up top just crying not wanting to do it but I felt like I really needed to do this trick when it's okay to be scared feeling uncomfortable sometimes I'm up for a day straight before trying a new trick I got the Jitters it's important to not push so hard that you're going and actually bringing yourself to tears because even though I went and brought the energy the juice to do it the reason why I felt that much fear wasn't because the trick itself is scary the Trick's just a 540 but because I went and built it up as such a big thing and I didn't have the actual tools to go and land this trick making it something instead of a snowbo trick something I can focus on like okay if I focus on my takeoff my snap instead was like throw down here and hopefully you land it uh it's actually this next one that's the full Misty attempt I'm sorry about that oh oh another one so I was trying to feel them uh but if you're too scared to do a trick it's a good sign but you're not ready to do it your eyes going to push a little bit of fear snowboarding but if you're crying feeling like you really don't want to do it feeling like you all you're going to get hurt it's okay to listen to that because here I got myself to try a back Ork 5 but I never had any chance of Landing it I definitely didn't have any chance of learning anything from it so here is the bad takeoff when trying to do a scary form what do you get a even worse takeoff so I'm even more broken at the waist my head is almost by my feet my hand is almost touching the ground as I take off the lip and the reason why doing a misty thr going straight down like a flip instead of a spin is so problematic is first you're not getting any pop off of jump you're throwing down through it second watch my head position from this point into this point I can't see anything that's going on imagine going off a 30 foot jump and you're throwing your head downward towards the snow you're blind for a good second of air time and when you only see the landing as you're about to face that's basically what doing this trick was for me and that's why I wasn't ready to do it so if your backside forms are breaking up the waste you're looking at anything like this take a step back learn with fundamentals get a strong 360 a good takeoff before trying to move on to these bigger tricks because it will make things way easier and way faster in the long run uh here my parents were giving me motivation some support uh that's a big thing that I had going for me is Parental support even like if I don't know snowboarding don't what's going on just having someone to support you uh help pick you off is really good because it's good to go and be critical of your riding breaking down what's working what's not working what isn't good is being hypercritical and what I had going on is I'd get critical about the aspects of snowboarding that didn't matter like Landing with 540 I was more bound about uh not Landing with 540 properly on contest but I was about my actual form so if you're going and self- coaching yourself and self- teing mindset really important you want to stay positive while staying Vigilant of where you can improve it's not a bad thing to be improving it's not a bad thing to be making mistakes that just means you're learning so I was really bad for going and setting it as like if I'm not doing my biggest tricks that day it's a bad day where really I should have focused more days on I'm going in the working on this fundamental today I don't care about the trick tricks are only extension of straight airs 50/50s so the tricks themselves aren't that important that said I was starting to move on to bigger rails trying to get some board slides on the Kink uh I get it sometimes but I was really inconsistent on these rails and that's because of how I was hitting them I was really going and doing a lot of pop up so you can see right here how I'm going and jumping but I'm away from the rail not for you letting my board come around this is making it so I'm not getting all the way on the rail and this is what I fluctuated between a lot this year of not getting all the way on the rail and getting too much on the rail and not being able to lock in this is all happening because of a takeoff if you're ever sliding off a rail early it's because of a takeoff rails aren't very much about balancing as much as they are about getting on it so right here you can see that I'm more angled towards the rail to try to get onto it more but I'm landing with my board completely flat on the rail so with that much angle with a flat Landing it's going to continue that side of his momentum pulling me off I recommend when you're hitting a rail to hit with the same angle and to really not try to jump up onto it instead try to ride a little bit into the side if you haven't watched snowbo addiction the videos I've been doing better we've been talking a lot about these principles and I really think it's worth checking out if you're trying to go and get better at rails because uh it says a lot hardship going in hitting rails properly instead of trying to jump buch of them and Tackle them I'll make some videos on that here too uh we'll see if there's any mistakes that we can go and show this example of but it's really a more detailed problem than we can just go on cover right here so here we have one of a few 360s that managed to or front side 360s that made to edit and let's see we can't really see it here so we won't spend much time on it but good rotation good pop uh looking up from blind Ling too soon that's why I watch my heels but honestly not a bad front free uh even though I'm a backside 360 spinner okay we'll actually break down my was fall happens quick uh front side spins are technically easier like front side freeze for just like smaller problems that you can make in your riding P will make them not work if you try to look over your shoulder don't work so there's a bunch of little things like that that make front freeze impossible if you're not doing it wrong but overall the form and technique is way easier so why does this slam happen on backboard I actually remember this moment I remember being very shocked because I felt like I was going to have it really good so let's see takeoff first thing we can notice is a lot of heal pressure a lot of weight over the rail that's making it so when I rotate yeah so see how much butts out this far this is making it so when I pop on a rail my butt's still out that far away from my board so I'm not balanced all the way over top of my snowboard and as I start sliding it's a little bit sleeper than I expected my weight is shifted back from that takeoff and that's causing me to slip out so that's just too much heal pressure too much leaned out you want to be more tall of your snowboard than that here we got my first ever back two on uh good rule if you can't back free don't try back to on it's basically a back fre with a rail there but my takeoff here is actually a little bit better I might take off of a jump you can really see though that even when I'm T trying to do like this trick still really leaned over basically full line bending the legs and I'm also taking off like right at the center of a rail if you're doing it back to on you really need to be to the side of a rail you're going drift a little bit and if you don't it's better to be slightly to the side of the rail and over top because this is just going to make you drift over uh but leaning forward like this won't work for a 2 somay on because you need to lead with your upper body on rotation so see how my arms blocking my rotation here that's going limit any ability I have to counter rotate and rebalance myself coming into a rail so that's just a blind hook very low chance of success and here is a part I'm most excited to talk about because we got POV footage of the worst break up away so you could possibly see uh so first thing I'm getting on my tow Edge too soon and as I'm getting on my tow Edge I'm actually leaning more into it and then I start snapping my spin too soon and I finish my snpp on my spin right here so watch my right arm that's my rotation being stopped because the hands reaching out to grab before the nose of a snowboard even comes off the lip if you're reaching down to the snow before your boards off the lip you messed up and you don't want to be doing that again uh so I'm throwing down finishing my snap before my board's even off the end this is causing me to do a couple things first scrub through second lose all my throwing momentum that's why we don't get much rotation uh the benefit is it puts my upper body in that good backside 360 position I have that arm leading so I'm going to be to get from my feet from here uh but you're never going to be able to completely finish rotation and that's why I'm landing under rotated to the heels because I don't have any pop I don't have any up to go and get control of this air making me very much a passenger here's that same uh trick on the same jump from a side angle it can really see that my motion is swoop down throwing two the toes and then pulling through that so this upper body position and everything's okay it just needs to be flat it can't be angled like this and the angle is coming from breaking up the waste and throwing down not throwing down spe very well because as you can see uh I didn't go and get any forward cork momentum uh but I starting to play around a bit more of rails here and starting to hit them a bit faster still not fast enough oh and that's why you don't try throw Misty fives uh downwards because you're going to get this we'll rewind it a little bit here just watch how are you supposed to land this trick if you do it Miss L you throw it down you see right here at 360 but you're already boned if you're under shooting or anything your head's just going straight into a knuckle if you want to Cork your spins don't throw them like a flip throw them like a spin that's a great piece of advice it'll save you a lot of hardship uh here's an example of what I mean by extending my legs and trying to dump so see how as I go and come onto this rail I'm trying to go big but I'm going and having my body fully extended no wind up if you're fully extended you lose any ability to balance so here I'm hitting the rail completely straight lagged with my upper body tall and bent there's no way you can go and cushion adjust move around like this and this is all happening because when I jump off the takeoff instead of going and letting myself right up and keep bending my body instead I'm going for a full extension whenever you're riding rails try to avoid full extensions as much as you can it makes it hard to balance on your Edge keep your center of mass in fact it's impossible to keep your center of mass when fully extended you can only keep your stacked position with a little bit of bending your legs so never fully extend on Rails uh one more thing that I really think is more important to note here is look at the stance I didn't know how to adjust bindings NE did my dad so I always had a wax stance whacked angles I didn't get this figured out for a couple of years but if you don't know how to set up a snowboard watch a YouTube video reference stance on your snowboards usually pretty good 912 on the angles super good uh having a good stance or at least close to the perfect stance is really beneficial you can be flexible it doesn't need to be super particular but you want to have a close to reference stance most people ride that and unless you want to be a super rail rider more narrow than reference isn't really necessary you can go like one notch a little bit but try to be within that range it's going to make you a better snowboarder trust me and yeah final recap for this year uh focus on your fundamentals focus on your tricks it might feel good and accelerating to move on and get a bigger trick get a dream trick but it's going to hurt you overall as a snowboarder if you're using proper form you can go and adjust it and make it work to a certain extent but you're going to find the limit of what you can do and I'm very excited for the next video on this because we'll be tackling my uh 2015 season and that's the first year I was able to ride five days a week so I was actually going and really thinking about snowboarding just making it my full Focus so I improved a lot but I also made a lot more mistake mistakes because of it and I really started to see the limits of what my form could do that said I don't go and fix like this break handle waste problem for a very long time it isn't until I mov to Whistler join Whistler Valley be but I actually went took a step back learned these fundamental principles and then was finally able to really grow as a rider so really I don't want to spoil stuff but up into the later years you're going to see me going and showing you how to do tricks in the in proper way way so here I'll be explaining why it's improper and how you can go and avoid with mistakes and hopefully learn in a more streamlineed way because if you go and take your time focus on these fundamental tricks stay positive but stay critical you'll be able to go and progress so much faster than someone going out there and hucking a trick that we're not ready for so if there's one takeaway from this video it's stay focusing on those fundamentals keep working on your tricks stay positive but don't go and Gaslight yourself into thinking you're better than you are get video yourself look at the forms if you see any of the mistakes that I went and highlighted in this video go and try to correct them think about them because these mistakes will carry over for a long time I have personal experience in that they won't fix themselves over time you have to take him the work to go and fix them yourself so thanks for watching uh we'll be back with the next episode to help you learn from my mistakes have a good one",

Instead, it's completely lifted, completely 90 chest tall. And he has really good upper and lower body separation here, what's letting him get that snap. And now he can go and use counter rotation. Bring the legs in, slowing down the maximum rotation velocity, giving him control, letting him get that grab sooner and hold it longer. And his head positioning perfect right on the knuckle. If we actually go and look at this full clip, we can see that his head's spotting at the knuckle the whole time. Down there at the knuckle, down there at the knuckle, and he's landing looking forward. How is this possible? Landing looking forward on a front three. I get asked this a lot and it's happening because he's going and setting his spot early on that knuckle and then he's setting a little bit extra rotation because remember how his upper body was so snapped here more rotation that he needs for the front side 360 keeping that eyes on the knuckle and going a little bit deep. So as he keeps his eyes on his the knuckle here he can sense that he still has a lot of air time he still has a lot of room to move. So instead of trying to fight and hold his rotation being still there, instead he's going to let his upper body continue rotating as the legs stay in place. And this continuation of letting the upper body rotate and letting the spot come through makes it so the board doesn't keep spinning. And basically, it's using counter rotation to slow down the spin instead of speed it up. So for anyone trying to do front side 360 spotting downhill, you need to snap film a little bit harder, get through the rotation a little bit sooner and you need to go a little bit bigger.",

      "fullText": "hey CRS this is the continuation of the learn for my mistakes series we're going to be sticking with 2015 because I have a couple more fundamental mistakes that I've been making that I wanted to dress and I'm feeling super excited for this video I'm finally feeling better less sick getting some good riding in so let's go break down these mistakes but you hopefully don't need to make them in your riding because let me tell you these things mess me up for a long time and not just on bigger tricks on smaller tricks as well so we'll be looking at these uh front side and backside mistakes but we're halting my progression and making it so snowboarding was a lot harder than it needed to be so let's get right into it starting with this back Misty five so something I didn't know when I was younger is that the point and the goal of doing a jump trick is to do it as safe as possible and chose spot as long as possible so a misty flip like this is seriously problematic because it leaves you at this point here halfway through the spin with your head looking straight up in the sky not giving you any awareness this doesn't only make the trick scer and harder but also removes a very important principle that you need and that's spotting the more you can spot a trick the more control you'll have over your rotation and that is something that took me a really long time to figure out so we're going to go and talk about why this isn't working and how I'd go and change it with high sight so the first thing I want to point out is I'm going and relying a lot on breaking at the waist in order to hold my Edge pressure this is happening because I'm not completely comfortable with holding that toe Edge and opening my hips uh if you're having trouble holding your tow Edge breaking forward it can be a problem with either your approach or you might just not have that toe Edge pressure figured out either way play around with us on the hill go down practice your setup car going down the mountain and that will keep you way better because you want to be making sure about your nice and tall and extending coming off the takeoff instead of collapsing so that's the first major issue here is at this point in the trick I should be completely tall over my board and I should be extending throwing over that tail but instead to generate that flip access I go and drop the shoulder towards the board what happens when you go and drop your shoulder in in of going extending over your tail is it makes it so you round in your back and that makes it so your rotational momentum is going to be thrown downwards like a front flip if you do it the other way for a front side it's going to be thrown backwards like a back flip and these up and down vertical rotational uh axises are way harder to control and adjust because they aren't flexible so what's wrong with this image here is that my upper bodies Lean Forward and my arm is dropping down this should have a straight extended torso and I should be taking my whole chest and dropping it towards my tail and that would let me leave off my tail where you can see here both my feet leave off a jump at the same time and that's because as I round forward and jump it goes and makes it so I'm too connected in my hips don't have that disconnect to actually leave off the tail so this is happening because I didn't realize the goal of the trick is to spot and control your axis in the air there here I keep it a little bit flatter because I don't throw down as much I use a Shifty so I'm able to spot at 270 but I don't have control over the axis so honestly the Shifty was a really good way to go and uh get around these problems because it made it so I could rotate with my upper body sooner slow down my rotation with my lower body so if you are trying to do a blind Noy Misty a shifty is a good way to do it uh we're going to go and break down some of these front side spins now because the front side principles I was applying here were not what I'd call cash money so here we have a cab free and there's a couple problems here first is this head position look at the head so I know that you need to spot looking uphill and I know that you need to keep your head looking forward uh speaking of I want to address just a problem that I see in people's riding really quick and it's letting their head r rotate too much off the takeoff so see how my eyes here are pointed straight in front of me this is actually even more rotated than you want to be the more rotation you set with your upper body the less you'll be able to keep your head looking forward and any trick like you're doing you're trying to keep your spot over by that knuckle point so by having the upper body rotated too much it'll make it so you actually need to go and change the whole trick instead of letting your upper body open and rotate instead you'll need to go and tuck your head right away trying to find that landing and that's pretty similar to what happens here my head I'm trying to hold the position but since I went and held my upper body in a fully extended position off the lifp my upper body isn't rotating and continuing and I'm making it so my head is stuck in place instead of continuing that rotation not using the constant spot and that makes it so I need to go and flip a around the motion uh it's really clear on where's that front side F 40 right here it's really clear and exaggerated on a front side five so on this front side five you'll see that I take off and look at how twisted up this body is getting the shoulders are fully rotated the head is tucked down looking under the armpit and this is leaving my legs behind and this is where we're seeing the disconnect in the upper and lower body and that's where you're seeing the shuffle here if you're using your arms and pulling them back aligned with with your spin that means you went and overe exaggerated the takeoff letting your upper body rotate too much as you left your legs behind in place so how do you go and fix this in your own writing you do that by just going and delaying your snap timing so here you can see that my body's in a fully extended position and then it holds it off a takeoff what I'd want to be do instead is snap a little bit later that way I can keep that momentum going and I want to make sure that I'm trying to get more extension out of my torso trying to get taller you don't want to be in this super compromised hit position we can call this the A-frame position if your body's a-f framing that means that you're going to have a disconnected core because in this position you can't keep a core strong you can't get it rotating you can only do that by being a little bit taller keeping everything more aligned you can even try this try squat down and try to activate your core it's going to be actively harder if you go and like Crouch back use a core it's actually going to use it so how are you going to go and generate power if you keep your upper body taller stronger you'll be able to use that full range of motion and when you go and compromise your core strength it makes you try to make up for the spin with other ways here I'm trying to do it by Leading the arms and leaning the head rotation causing my upper and lower body to get disconnected I still have this problem in like cab NES but I'm gonna fix it this year gonna do it and that's resulting in two things first of all I'm not able to spot in front of me so see how at 180 here my eyeballs are looking back at the takeoff really what I'd want here is for my head to have been here and been pulling leading around the rotation keeping the spot underneath the arm another big problem we're seeing here is this arm is going and blocking my view and that's making me need to look up and around my shoulder whenever you spot up and over your shoulder it's going to change your axis rotation while elongating your Spine and Neck making it harder to rotate and keep everything connected and stack this results in me needing to do what's called a double spot where I spot once then I whip my head around to spot again you're trying to avoid these head whip motions because as you're whipping your head you can't see anything so as you lose spot for any duration of time in the spin you lose a sense of where you're at and you lose any ability to micro adjust whenever you're rotating a spin working on it it's going to be having micro adjustments the whole way if you're doing a backside 360 you're using your core you're using your upper body to readjust your axis and pull yourself into landing the whole time but when you're going and looking away from The Landing you can't go and keep activating and pulling because you don't know where you're at so that makes it so as you're going and rushing your head around for that second spot you're not going and actually engaging your muscles to pull yourself into the Landing making it way harder to land at both feet at the same time combin that with usually when the double spots used it's going to go and stretch and look over the shoulder I don't know why this happens but it's way more natural for people to try pull into a spin like this or like this looking over shoulder instead of pulling in chin down so if you are going and getting your head stuck trying to get this powerful position uh what you can do is make sure that you're keeping your chin tucked in and pulling down underneath arm and that will put you on a way better axis when trying to elongate and look over so all that combined results in a very tail heavy Landing because I'm not ready for the landing with this takeoff if all the funk that happened I might have been able to still get a decent 540 if I just would have had my head positioned looking a little bit straighter so then I could have used my upper body to pull into a spin so those are my main issues is just using too much of the takeoff you can see for his method throwing my legs up to me I wasn't separating my snap to my spins I was trying to combine them and when you try to combine everything into one point off the takeoff it gets hectic and you can really see it on this back seven here I go and throw my Axis rotation wrong because I broke out the waist and then I try to use a double spot and pull around the shoulder making it some blind com at Landing compromised and result under rotated 90° tons of impact act hard on the hip and honestly really dangerous as long as you can see where you're going you can make these trips infinitely safer and by determining the access rotation and getting comfortable with it it will go and just make it so much easier so was there a few mistakes that really fight me this year and we'll go and continue with the next video of how I went and worked around these to go and improve my riding uh sorry I let this one drag on a bit but we'll be back with another one soon have a good one and peace out",

      "fullText": "in this video we're going to go over the steps you need to take in order to get your front boards to the next level currently you have a lot of the correct Baseline principles needed to execute a proper front board you're just making a few slight mistakes on the takeoff that are going to make it really hard to get the front board dialed in so that's where we're going to go and tackled now so currently when you're taking off you have a few problems first you're letting your board preemptively start sliding across the takeoff when you go and takeoff early like this and start letting your board slide it's going to make it so when you're extending you need to extend all the way straight to actually get that feeling of popping off the lip and when you go and hyperextend like this it has a few really detrimental effects first of all it's making it so you're completely straight when you're completely straight in your body like this you don't have as much range of motion to H rotate throughout your hips making it hard to get the front Bard around it also makes it so your weight is set really strongly over your toe Edge and when your weight's set strongly over your toe Edge when taking off for a front board it's going to make it so you're leaning forward back towards the takeoff causing you to go and land onto your tow Edge when you land tow Edge first on CH rail you're going to have to spend your time rebalancing your body position from leaned to centered if you're going and trying to rebalance your initial body position it's going to make it so you're not going and changing your stack position in correlation to where your board is on the rail instead you're trying to just find that Bas front board position and that's why we're seeing you go and lose balance here and struggle with the feature so what you need to do here is what I'm doing on the left keep more Bend in your hips letting you go and keep your weight set over the rail setting your weight over the rail like this really helps because it makes it so when you pop up you're naturally getting pushed sideways without need to rely on turning towards the feature making it so you're getting over the rail with less sideways momentum the next thing you need to do is make sure that you're maintaining more Bend in your legs by by maintaining this hinge forward and bending your legs it gives you way more of a platform to rotate your hips around and that's what you need in order to get that full front side board side position the next mistake that you're making is instead of going and Landing with your board angled up what you should be doing on the tube you're going and Landing with your board nose first in a downward angle when you're Landing with your board downward it's going to make it so when you hit these round surfaces your momentum is going to carry you off rail causing you to go and slide off The Far Side so even though you don't have much sideways momentum here you're going and making it so that you're going to be sliding off a rail every time but if you go and hit the rail if your board slightly angled upwards it's going to make it so you're hitting the side of a feature what kills a lot of your sideways momentum and then after that you use a little bit of that sideways momentum to rock you over back to Center so that's the key when doing a front board on like a small down rail like this is hitting with that slight bit of angle upwards and then rocking over to flat so we're going to go over to your next front board attempt here and this one your takeoff is a lot straighter you're a lot more patient with it but we can see that your body weight is really set forward to towards your toe Edge causing your board to angle upwards so the reason why this is happening is because you don't have enough hinge in your hips if you had more hinge in your hips forward more bending your legs it would naturally make it so your weight's going to be set over the rail with less air time allowing you to go and take off straighter but still getting on the rail your biggest mistake on this one though is right here you're coming in and you're pushing your front foot down into the rail causing you to land with its downward angle really drastically that's going to make it so you shoot across the rail and that's why you're going and sliding down early if we compare that on the left I'm going and using a lot smaller ver poot motion instead of going and trying to get airborne I'm trying to get as little air as possible and rely on this angle of the snowboard to help me get up and over the rail this is a much more consistent way to get on the rail because as soon as you start trying to balance impact you're not going to be able to commit to having your upper body as open because a more open upper body doesn't absorb impact as well as a stacked body so we want to go and lessen the amount of uh air we're getting onto a feature we can really see it here you're going and doing a full on pop shoulders lifting body extending this is making it so you have to do two motions your full extension then your rotation and that's making it so there's more components where it can go long here it went and set it so your eyes are down this way making it so your body weight is set slightly too much over your toes and that's going to make it so for balancing you're going need to go and fight and we can see that you're slowly leaning towards your toe Edge throughout the duration of this rail finishing sliding off your toes early if we go to the left here I'm keeping my board completely straight not digging that toe Edge at all you can see that I'm almost leaving completely flat based the reason why I can do this is because of how exaggerated my weight is set over the balls of my feet uh by having my body hinged forward that's my hand so my head is basically already over the rail so here instead of needing to worry about pop up my legs can just worry about rotating out so I'm letting my board ride all the way off then just rotating the hips trying to keep my head as level as possible I want you to really focus on my head positioning here watch out how it just goes and stays in the same spot from straight to rotate it see how there's no movement between leaving the lip and then hitting the rail this just helps you balance combine that with going and using that angled takeoff to kill your sideways momentum and then rocking over to Flat let you stay way more squared helping you get front boards so much more consistently so what you need to do to get your front boards to the next level is keep more Bend in your body keep more Bend in your legs let your upper body hinge forward a little bit more not breaking up the waist you'd never want to be putting more weight on your tow Edge to cause you to turn off you should be leaving relatively close to flat base so just keeping enough Bend forward where you're having weight set over your balls your feet and your head is more towards the center of a rail then you want to go and instead of going extending your whole body up fully extended keep a little bit of Bend in your body trust that you're going get up and over the rail then as you rotate your board instead of going and popping over just let your board slam into it with that slight bit of angle and that's going to go and let you catch the rail and then that little bit of sideways momentum you do have will help you go and roll over the rail from there you can just keep your centered point a little bit more on your board it should be easier to do hitting these steps more correctly and that's going to allow you to get a much cleaner front board making those tests will probably help your front boards get to the next level anyone watching this video we actually go and do these video analysis for all of our addiction Plus members addiction plus is our online subscription service we

The next thing we're going to want to do for this is just grind it out. Get really comfortable with pulling it through. This should be second nature to you before going and trying the actual 360 because this is much easier. Now, let's talk about snapping position with the shoulders. A lot of people think that when you want to spin, you got to drive your shoulders and close them off completely. But actually, we hardly need any rotational force with the upper body. Once we start moving on to like 720s, we'll want to leave rotation more with our upper body to generate more rotation. But on a backside 360, if we go and throw our upper body too much, it's going to disconnect our core and make it really hard to connect it and control the power. So, as we're going and throwing the spin, coming out for the neutral, I want you to have your shoulder not coming further than the inside of your knee. So, see how the shoulder's coming inside of the knee. And the next thing we're going to talk about is rounding.",

But I realized that that's adding a whole extra motion that you can take out just by making it so when you're coming on your toe edge, you're already having your upper body in the position that would be needed for the front side rotation.

So here, I'm pushing my back leg down, letting my front leg coming up, and you're going to see that I'm coming in tailheavy. Tail heavy is basically the safety net of jumping because it lets us go and disperse our impact a little bit more and catch ourselves. We'll go and have some more examples for this, but you can see a very tall extended body slightly set over the tail and legs almost completely extended but not fully. This position is actually perfect. And while I'm doing it, I'm maintaining a slight hinge. And now, as I absorb the impact, I let myself disperse into a more exaggerated version of that position. hips back, upper body forward. Weight still set over the balls of the feet because we're pushing the hips back. It's going to want to shift you to the heels. So, we need to really pull that upper body forward in order to stay balanced. And the reason why we can get away with landing like this is even though my hips are positioned so my weight's over my back foot because my upper body is pulled forward, when we combine that with impact, it's naturally going pull my body into the landing direction of the slope. This is the technique used by every pro snowboarder, including someone as legendary as Arthur Longo. Pops up, keeps that angle, lands tail heavy, pushes through. So, as he leaves the takeoff, upper body slightly forward, hips slightly back. And as he goes and jumps and bends his legs up, his upper body keeps pulling forward and his hips keep shifting back. And as he comes into the landing, he now fully extends into this position. And look at how aggressive his tail angle is, giving him so much room to absorb it. But he's not going and leaning his whole body towards that tail. Instead, that upper body is rotated open, shifting towards that front foot, hinge of the upper body, keeping the weight over the balls of his feet. So, as he comes and tries to disperse the energy, tail first to the front leg. And as he absorbs it, he gets pushed back more into that position, but he doesn't slip out because his upper body keeps pulling forward in correlation to the hips being set back, allowing him to go and absorb a lot of impact.

      "fullText": "in this video we're going deep dive one of the most important fundamental principles in all of freestyle snowboarding that is popping your favorite snowboarder does it every Pro does it anyone hitting a rail jump or riding a cliff in the back country is using this fundamental principle and you're about to learn every single thing there is to know about it so let's jump right into it let's start simple what is a pop a pop is referring to just trying to maintain contact with your board and the takeoff of the feature until it snaps off the end matching the angle of the take off the whole way not letting your board Flex we're doing this because that's going to give us the most air the most control and then we're trying to go and keep it a smaller motion when we're not flexing our board because that gives us the largest surface to work with while letting us keep our upper body in a neutral position a neutral position is really important when going and hitting a jump because that's what lets you bring up your legs get control whenever you're going and hitting a jump doing a rotation you're trying to to keep your weight set at the same point so even as I'm flailing here my center of mass is set over that same point I took off on and that is the goal of the pop to fully utilize your snowboard while maintaining the same centered point and it starts to give you a lot more air the smaller the feature so here I'll be honest this one's a little bit like an Ollie and that's because I'm trying to really maximize this motion and because this feature so small it's giving me a lot of extra air time so if I went and jumped with both feet at same time I'd be leaving off around there where my tail is still making contact but by extending this motion all the way through I'm able to go and get this whole extra board length of height without even leaving the ground and this is how you get so much height on a snowboard even off of small bumps so I'm coming in loading up and I shift my weight slightly to my back foot you want to do this weight shift as you're going and squatting down and then as you extend you want to shift your weight back to Center this is because the only reason you're shifting to your back foot is in order to maintain pressure on your tail but if you leave off the takeoff if yourself still angled towards that back foot there's going to be nothing but'll throw you up and over in order to fully do this pop we need to keep a little bit of weight on our toe Edge not so much that we're going and starting to lean forward and dig in we still need our weight completely centered over our board but we want a little bit of edge pressure especially for little side hits like this in order to go and keep traction with the snow and keep popping off that point if your board's flat based it won't have grip so it's going to slip around and if that happens as you're trying to push power through it it's not going to let you push that power through the same set point and that's a really important part of this you're trying to go and set your Edge set your weight in that stacked position and then push from that position all maintaining the same balance point that said you can go and shift a little bit to flat base as I go and extend my legs I'm actually getting my board Less on that edge and less angled making it so I'm Tak taking off more and more flat base this is because I'm getting enough force and traction my board and it's for a short enough period of time I don't need to worry about it kicking weird so I can go and flatten base in order to do what keep my body more straight over top of my snowboard the more weight you're putting straight down into that tail the more it's going to pop you up if you have weight to lean forward you have weight a little bit on that edge it's not going to give you as clean of a up and down pop that'll give you that extra height here you'll notice that my chest is open open 90 this is because I'm going into a banked feature and in order to prepare for this I'm just opening my chest to make it so my board naturally pulls up to the angle I'm trying to land in and that's really the key to going and getting these pops pushing into a jump fully riding off the feature Mikey citarelli making great tutorials by the way go check him out is talking about shaping your board to a feature you want to imagine your board going and merging with a feature connecting and going and molding onto it as it pops off making it an extension so here you can see I'm coming up on a very high angle not much transition and I'm letting my board warp around the takeoff making it so I can maintain contact and make sure my board's connected with it as long as possible and we're going to compare that to the clip on the right a two-footed jump so here I'm using the same principles of extending bringing everything together and popping off my board the only difference is I'm not letting myself first shift back this is making it so as I go and pop up my weight is evenly distributed between both my feet so as I go and extend what happens is you start leaving off both feet at the same time this will do one thing and it's going to go and make it so your tail leaves off at the same time as your front foot the reason why this is such a problem for jumping on your snowboard is because of two things first it's not fully utilized the feature if I would have pushed through this feature I would have been able to keep my board in contact up into this point and that would have put me another half a board length in the air before popping off the end that's like a whole extra foot and a half of air I missed by letting my board come up early and the second thing that's happening is both legs are extending at exactly the same time when both your legs are extended in for Max pushed out position it's going to make it so your upper body becomes completely straight when you have a straight upper body you lose the ability to keep your weight set over the balls of your feet that stacked point so even though we're taking off in that stack Point as we go and push up it's actually pushing us slightly back into a neutral position when you're vist tall and extended it's making it so it's going to be really hard to keep the core connected where if we compare that to the pop you can see that I'm going and shifting my weight on CH back foot slightly going in molding my board inch that transition and as I do that I let my upper body come forward so my front leg straight still a little bit of Bend in my back leg and my upper body is now pulling back to this neutral position and then as the board snaps off the snow that little bit of kick is actually what shoots your legs back up to you and shoots your board back out to even that's why it's so important when you're doing this to get the right timing to go and snap off the end of the lip because when you're doing something like an Olie you're generating that snap that force yourself through flexing the board but when you're doing a pop you're not trying to flex your board so that means in order to get that snap you need to make sure you're pushing off the end of the jump and that's what gives that snap motion but this is so beneficial because of right here this little bit of hinge in the hips it doesn't look like much compared to this but I'm telling you this is everything this lets me keep my core engaged and by keeping my core engaged it lets my legs come up to me and that's going to be crucial for going and bringing in your grabs bringing your tricks and generating your spins and just looking at a effect now that it has in the air if we go and watch through you can see that I'm having a moment of weightlessness right here my arms are up my core is fully extended my legs are completely straight if we compare that to the peak of the jump on the left you can see my legs are bent up my core is ready I'm already positioning myself to get into that landing and that's why we're going and doing this tail and doing this rock Forward Motion because it goes and makes it so your weight is trans transferring throughout your board allowing you to keep your core tight and you're not relying on fully extending in order to get that power because if you fully extend it leaves you without a connected body and that's going to make it so your legs fall behind a little bit so you can see I bring my legs up and I give them up to me but I have that moment where I'm fully extend extended and weightless if you go and have that moment when you messed up the takeoff got bucked it's going to go and really exaggerate that and you'll need to really flail to get back together so goal of a pop here is really to try get into the air with as little bit as little Funk as possible and with as much height as possible so here we have a heel side approach and the heel side is a little bit different first I want you to notice that I'm not coming in on my heel Edge even though this is a heel Edge approach feature I'm coming in in my stacked on toe position what I'm doing instead of getting on my heel Edge is angling my whole board towards the feature this is going to make it so I don't need to ride as long on the heel Edge what good because I don't care how good you are less time on the heel Edge is easier to control and then I start to transition to my heel Edge at a really crucial spot right here at the spoon of a jump the reason why I don't want to be at heels at this point is because this is the highest GeForce part of the jump and when you're on more of an edge more pressure gets put onto that single point so if I was on a heel Edge coming into something this steep it's going to put more pressure on me and make it more likely that'll go and sit backwards losing that stacked position that's going to let me pop up so the solution is to come in on a tow Edge and then once you start getting onto that uphill pitch you went and already absorbed the transition that's when you go and start to switch to that heel Edge and then from there I enter this heel Edge stock position it's slightly different from a tow Ed stock position because you can't use your shins you can't push your hips forward in order to keep more weight on that point with holding that edge making it so you need to rely on more Bend in the legs so the reason why I'm more crouched down here a little bit weird of a form is because I'm on that heel Edge and I have an awkward angle but my weight is still set straight over that heels and my upper body is going to do the same thing it's going to shift slightly back right here you can see it slightly back and then as I go and extend my legs my upper body comes back to neutral that combined with the kick of a feature goes and snaps me off and here you can see that I'm not actually riding all the way to the top of the feature but I'm still popping and getting that snap off the tail of the board so here I could have been a little more patient got a little more height but that's not taking everything to account because the reason why I went and made it so my board popped up a little early is because the transition short and that's a thing the only reason you're trying to go and ride to the end of the feature and fully use your board is to get maximum height if you don't need that much height you can go and use a little more Bend use a little bit of an Olie to let yourself pop before that point in order to give you a more controllable air here we have a really nice pop off a jump and you can tell it's a perfect pop because I don't need to do anything in the air I pop it and the angle of the jump naturally sinks me up into the angle of the landing and this is the goal every time you go and hit a jump to have your takeoff naturally syn you up into the landing so you don't need to make any micro adjustments so how are we achieving this as you go from the flat to uphill transition through a jump you get the most gForce right here at that transition point and when we're going through a transition point we want to make sure that we're keeping our weight off that edge as much as possible because that's going to let us go and push more pressure into the center of our board and if we're on an edge and there's more pressure it's going to go and load it causing our board to turn off more so I go flat base through that point and then I enter a very slight bit of edge pressure so here it looks like I'm riding off completely flat base the key difference is I'm slightly gripping the sow on my tow Edge because I'm letting my upper body come up and over as my legs go down so if you have no Bend in your legs you can stay completely straight but any bit of Bend of your legs is going to put your hips back and as your hips go back in order to keep your Center and mass at the same point your upper body needs to go forward so because I have a little bit of bending my legs in order to keep my balance point at the same spot I need to let the upper body come over in the same amount in correlation to the legs so the more power you're trying to go and get out of a jump the more you're going to squat down the more you squat down the more the hips go back and the upper body comes forward because you're trying to maintain the same balance point through the in run through a takeoff through the air and into the landing because keeping that single balance point is what lets you get in the air with that core control you can imagine if you're changing your balance Point like let's say I went off his takeoff and switched into going off my heels last second that's was going to go and do a couple things first it's going to make it so my pressure instead of being here would be set here to correspond this I need to go and put my hips out more upper body more and that make it so when I pop up my legs would go and get pushed forward as my upper body gets pushed back disconnecting me so a reason why we're trying to keep our balance point over this position specifically is twofold first a little bit of tow Edge is nice for gripping snow you can see the takeoff isn't perfectly smooth all these little grooves and divots are going to do a lot to go and bump you and move you off track so that little bit of edge helps you grip in and make sure that funk doesn't get you it also keeps your weight very over top of your board making it so all of your power all that GeForce all that snap is being driven straight down instead of across if we go and leave this take take off of edge pressure this way Edge pressure this way that's going to make it so the power is pushing us that way pushing us this way but if we go and make sure that we're taking off as flat based as possible that's going to push us up completely making it so all of our power is being used to go upwards with The Arc of a jump and not being wasted going to the side and getting crossed that's why I actually get more flat based as I extend my legs as I extend my legs that's making it so I have less Bend in them if I have less Bend in my legs my torso doesn't need to be as over my toes this lets me go and as I go and push through the extension I'm able to go and get taller flattening that base and getting an even smoother takeoff but I'm never going and getting fully extended even though my legs look completely straight here we're still like a passive straight for not locked out and we can tell we're not locked out because I'm still able to keep that little bit of forward position in my up body if you go and let your legs get fully locked out get the body fully straight it's going to do like we saw on the side hit and give you that moment of unbalanced so if you do have any flaws of a takeoff it's going to frill you off what I'm telling myself every time I do this pop is to get into my stack position and push off the tail while trying to keep everything connected in the core in the board we're just trying to not have any chest opening any Funk any closing just no Funk we're trying to keep as smooth and steady of a body posture as possible now let's talk a little bit about allies and how this differs from Pops because I get what you're saying leaning back pushing off a tail it sounds a lot like an OE the difference with an OE is that it's a full motion where you go and start over your front foot shift to your back foot and explode off that tail relying on the snap of a board so here I'm using an Olie off a very kicky jump and we can tell it's an OE right here see how my boards going and curving upwards this is going to give me the most possible power but it has the massive downside of being a very committed Point see how at this point here my front foot is leaving off a takeoff a little bit sooner than necessary this is making it so I have more power and more pressure being put into a smaller part of my snowboard and I don't know if you know about balancing but think about standing on one of your toes the less surface area you have the more it's going to be susceptible to your surrounding and it's going to be hard to hold your balance so when you're going and doing an Olie it's harder to stay balanced and you're flexing your board so it's going kick you a lot harder and that's the beauty of the OE and why we want to use it on some features because it goes and kicks up your board to you but when you use it on a jump it takes a little bit time to pull everything back together because you did such a big motion and you have so much GeForce to control here is a perfect feature that you'd want to use an Allie I'm going in prey alling so I can pop up and boost into that transition at the end this is because the landing is super short and I don't want to land flat so I'm going using my Aly motion rocking from the front foot to the back foot and notice here how in order to do this I need to be really extended and my torso is more tall this is because I need to really generate a lot of power into that tail to make it snap off the end and the only way to do that is to get Max extension as you go and extend your steal it makes it so your joints are more strong everything's more strong like if you're trying to hold something up would you rather hold it in a full squat or would you rather hold it with this straighter leged position locking your legs that makes it so more power gets pushed into that tail and then it goes and gets bounced back when you have a little bit of Bend in your legs it's going to absorb a little bit of that power and that's going to really impact an oy because you're trying to rely on that power to flex that board to get you that takeoff that pop that'll bring your everything together so that's why all these are really good for side hits controlling speed but you don't want to re use them off jumps because it goes and has all those problems and becomes really hard to time and this is the best Showcase of how effective the pop is here I'm literally just riding not extending my legs at all just maintaining contact with my board and the snow and you can see just by maintaining contact it naturally puts my front foot over top of a rail so just by going and maintaining contact into the end of a feature and hitting the feature with enough speed to get like 30 50% down you can hit most rails in most Parks without ever needing to pop and this is so beneficial because if you don't need to pop you don't need to extend your legs allowing to hold your stacked position so here I'm literally holding the same position through the takeoff through the air onto the feature and through a landing my upper body my legs my Center balance is not changing until I go into absorb that uh Landing uh here we have the problem with the coast and that is if you let your yourself get GED out it's going to go and actually absorb the take off throwing off balance so here I'm letting my legs Bend up and the reason why this is a problem is right here see my nose drooping down this is making it so I'm no longer going up on the same angle of the takeoff but instead I'm drooping forward and that's going to make it so my weight is being sent over my front foot and when that happens you need to use a Readjustment in order to not nose pick making it so you don't get full pop you don't get full control here is an exaggerated example in this one I'm actually going and sucking down lower as I get off the takeoff this is making it so my tail lifts off early because I'm not pushing through the jump it doesn't know want you snap off and it's making it so I'm absorbing the lip of the jump and that's making my board even out early it's going to go and throw us over that nose so that's going and putting me through the jump and not putting me on the right jump angle and if you're not on the right angle you need to go and make adjustments this is why popping is also so important for every single spin you do on your snowboard you can't go and do an ollie when you're going and doing a spin that's because allies require a body motion and every one of your spins requires a body motion so if you want to Allie with one you need to combine two motions into one and it's really hard so here on this front side 360 you can see I'm maintaining contact with a takeoff until my tail snaps off the end I'm going and keeping my upper body body set over my toes so my center of balance is at that same point but I get what you're saying but you're leaving off your heels I'm trying to leave as flat based as possible and I'm trying to go and preemptively set my weight as flat based as possible because when you land a front side 360 your weight needs to be on your tow Edge so yes I'm leaving off my heels but I'm trying to position my body position my core to go and leave as centered as possible just getting enough heel pressure to hold the line and flattening it out as I go and extend the spin to the extent that you can go and pre-spin backside a little bit this has been such a GameChanger for me because it now makes it so I'm not completely reliant on the angle of my takeoff in order to not drift allowing me to get a lot more power so on this backside 360 I'm getting on my toe Edge through of a spoon of a jump and you can see that I'm on my tow edge here but as I go and frow a spin I'm actually letting myself go and become more tall allowing me to flashing that edge and when I'm flashing that edge it's letting me go and pop off with less Edge pressure this is really important because it lets me go and take off in this super stacked upright position if you take off with Edge pressure it's going to make it so you're leaning to match that angle so the more you pre-spin the more you lean the more your weight is going to be rotating around your head and you really want your rotation to be set around your balls of your feet because as I'm doing this backside 360 watch what happens when I bring my legs up my upper body goes forward in correlation to my hips going back keeping my Cent Mass set over the same point over the balls of my feet what this does is it lets me keep my core engag for the full rotation allowing me to lead with my upper body and seamlessly utilize counter rotation and that's only possible through making sure you keep a strong connected core this gets even more true as you start moving on to bigger spins so here tow Edge and as I go and snap the spin start extending a me remember as you extend your legs that means you don't need a as much angle in the Torso because your hips aren't back as much allowing you to keep your Center Point even with a taller posture but then the difference is when you go and start doing bigger tricks like this you're now trying to go and match your whole angle of rotation over that back foot so I'm going and shifting my weight to my back foot and setting my whole upper body over it this is because that will go and put me up with the angle of the jump and it will go and make it so I go and continue that rot rotational access that will put me into the landing that's why I can land Perfect 2 ft at the same time like this and how am I Landing weight set over that same point of the ball as my feet first you need to make sure you're hitting your stack position your stack position depends on who you are but you're trying to keep your weight set over your edge with as little Edge pressure as possible allowing yourself to stay as tall as possible the more you squat down the more your legs will need to bend and the more you'll need to hinge forward but you need a little bit of Bend in order to go and push into your snowboard because you need that range of motion in the knees in order to go and actually get that pushing feeling from there you're trying to push for your snowboard while keeping your Center balance set over the exact same point we don't want our Center balance to be shifting uh you can go and flatten it out a little bit as you go and get flatter because that's going to make it see pop off of less of the edge and here watch these frames this is a prime example of pushing off the lip see how my board is going and snapping down right there it's one frame it's here and then it's down and that's showing us that I'm putting so much pressure into my tail I'm pushing so hard into it that my board's actually snapping off the end so this might be a little bit of an over snap but even as I'm going and pushing that hard this is the power of the stack position and the pop I'm not going and needing to go and lift my upper body so the reason why this is so important for power and getting control getting big airs is because I'm able to go and get maximum power maximum Force off the Jump but without needing to lift allowing me to keep my Center balance at the same point from the takeoff into the air this lets you go and use that pop and bring everything together because you have no point of being disconnected and from there because you got a good pop you're on the perfect angle of a jump so you don't need to use your upper body your legs or anything to readjust and then you have so much extra control from going up and having your only moment momentum being up and over fact it doesn't matter if you go big need to readjust because your airtime travel is so smooth so consistent it's easy to control and adjust so even here going this big watch my upper body even though my legs shift down I poke out my center of balance is staying over the same point I go and extend my legs but I'm still keeping my center of balance over my toes all this adjustment all this funk and my Center balances over the same spot and this makes it so when I hit the L Landing my Edge is able to grip in making sure that I don't get all any funky business coming down on the landing because if you go land flat face on a little bump here there's a something here it will throw you off so we're trying to land on that little bit of edge pressure and then as I go and squat down and absorb it I let my chest come down as my hips go out here you can see I'm not doing it completely perfect because I'm getting more and more pressure onto my tow Edge ideally your Center balance is staying at exactly the same point I'll leave you with this one final note every motion you do in snowboarding is going to try break your stack position be it carving be it rails be it spins if you open your hips it's going to go and change the variables you need for a stack position but through working through your stack position figuring out how to go and wind up load up and explode off your tail all when maintaining that same Center of balance that's what gives you control and that's what gives you power so if you're struggling with your straight airs you're struggling with your turns you're struggling with any part in your snowboarding think about your positioning think about how your body is moving and ask yourself am I maintaining a stack position through this whole range of motion if you're doing a front side board slide and slipping out ask yourself are you completely in the same balance point through the whole trick if you're doing a spin and lose balance ask yourself am I going and doing anything that's thrilling off my balance at any point you do that and train it and it will make you a fantastic snowboarder that can shred any terrain and do any trick",

These tips and tricks are not only applicable for the most beginner backside spins, but also for the most advanced. And by unlocking them, you're going to expand your range of motion, expand your control, and land the best backside rotations of your life. The first motion that we need to really get locked in is the in run. The point of the inr run isn't just to go and set us up so we can get onto our tow edge, but we're actually going and getting our hips open. Here's an example. If I'm going and winding up a backside spin and I'm going just straight position, heels to toes. I'm here. That's only giving my hips this much room to rotate. But watch what happens when I go and preemptively open my hips. This makes it so as I pop up, I now have this much room to rotate.",

      "fullText": "hey shredders Tavis here and in this video we're going deep dive into the why behind the front side setup carve letting you fully understand the how behind it front side setup cars are one of the most important underlining principles of any front side spin so understanding why you're doing each part of the turn the heel side the toe side wind ups snaps will help you fully grasp how to do them let you go and build a better structure in your head letting you make changes to your form so you can better suit it to different tricks and different jumps just letting you get a better grasp on this trick than just learning a textbook way of how to do it so we're going to start with what of the main goals of each setup card the main goals are to one eliminate as much drift as possible drift makes tricks way harder and makes them much trickier to land and the second is to give yourself a good Edge platform to go and generate snap and rotation off of so there's a few ways we do this the first is every setup carve comes in with the toe Edge shifting to the heels and then you go and wind up and snap but why are you doing this that's because when you're going and getting on your tow Edge it does a couple really important things the first thing it does is it angles your board all the way to the corner of the jump what this does is makes it so as you go and switch to your heel Edge it helps you go and disperse the turn making it so you go and can hold a straighter line if you go from a straight point and immediately try to switch to heel Edge that's going to cause you to turn and start drifting off the Jump will lead to drift and it will make it so you can't grip as much and in order to do this properly what we want to do is make sure that we're coming into the jump as straight and light on our Edge as possible and then digging it in so we can go and try transition to flat base and bend our heels through the spoon of the jump the reason why we want to go and have this little bit of flat base motion before getting straight to your heels is because of back and forth sway when I'm on my toe edge here in order to hold the toe Edge I need to have my whole upper body set over here getting that bending of the leg to hold that pressure what this does is it makes it so my head is away from my snowboard the more tow pressure I put in the further my head will be away from my snowboard what makes it so as I go and transition edges it's going to go and wish wash back and forth so we can see that here right now my snowboard is in a straight line behind my body and as I switch to my heel it actually pivots and travels across the takeoff a lot more than my upper body so my upper body here is staying relatively stationary but because I have my tow Edge setup carved in it goes and shifts and traverses across the slope this creates a lot of sideways momentum there's two ways we go and avoid the sideways momentum messing us up first one I don't do very well here but you can go and take a wider approach will let you hold a more consistent angle angle coming into the jump letting you get a smoother transition the slower and lighter of an angle you do your turn the lighter the transition and The Rock back and forth is going to be so that's a great way to do it and the next way we go and do it is by going and making sure that we're keeping our body as aligned over our snowboard as physically possible if you have your chest all the way over here is going to keep your feet further away if you're going and keeping yourself more stacked and over your snowboard bow then when you go and transition your edges it will throw you off a lot less drastically and the last thing that we're going really go and pay attention to here is when we go and transition to the heel Edge this is one of the biggest problems I see people have with snowboarding and that is trying to get onto your Edge too soon this position right here fully wound up set over her heels ready to snap is a really hard position to hold and that's because it's going and using your upper body to prep for generating rotation and it's going keeping weight over your heel Edge this is going to put a lot of pressure onto your heels making your board want to turn off if I held this position for an extended period of time and if anyone did it would slowly start to turn down the slope and that makes this a timing Factor as well as a form factor you can't go and hold this position forever so you need to know when to get into it and the first part of getting into this position is making sure that your whole upper body is stacked aligned with the snowboard you don't want to be opening your chest towards the front of the takeoff because that's going to preemptively extend your core so the reason why we're keeping everything aligned and tight shoulder squared closed off to that angle of the jump is because it's going to let us go and shift into that position without going and need to compromise or form open up lose potential power so this stacked over your board position is really important to hold until you do your wind up because as we go and wind up on a front side spin we're going and doing something called closing the front shoulder and that's where this front hand here gets pulled towards our back knee and this is going to be what sets us up for torsion and snap a lot of people here will go and immediately have your chest open Square to the jump when your chest is open towards the jump that's going to limit your maximum range of motion of rotation so if we go and look at it right here you'll see that I'm very squared very stacked over my board and then I open up if I was approaching the jump with my chest in this open position as I snapped I'd only have this much room to work with to actually generate power and that's why making sure that you're coming in closed off is so important because it extends the range of motion you can use without hyperextending yourself and when this is done correctly you'll be able to go and get that smooth takeoff in a straight line but we have a little bit more we need to dive into here I know it's pretty Tech but this stuff is all really important and fundamental to snowboarding so stick with me so as we're transitioning from toe Edge to heel Edge you'll see that I'm holding a little bit of a flat base period this is just to go and decrease that sideways momentum slow everything down and make it so as I transition to my heels it will be easier to lock in that edge this is actually true for whenever you're carving on a snowboard too uh you don't generally want to go straight from edge to edge because that's going to have you swaying rocking a lot it's a lot better to add a little bit of flat base before going and channeling that edge so here the main things I'm trying to achieve is light tow Edge pressure that's holding a consistent angle towards the left corner of a jump and then I want to start transitioning to a flat base and through my heel heels through this part right here the spoon of the jump this changes a little bit depending on the size of the jump the speed you're taking into it because it's not as much about uh the part of a jump you're getting onto your heel Edge but the time you're spending on the lip because we can only hold this heel Edge position so long if we're hitting like a big jump where you need to go really slow we want to get onto this position as late as possible so we don't need to hold that position on the heel Edge longer than necessary but generally it's going to be through the spoon of the jump you want to do your transition position and hold your flat face and that's because this is where the most G's are when you're going through this flat base to uphill part of the feature that's going to be the most gForce you have because you're changing from downward angle flat to uphill putting a lot of pressure on the EG legs so if you're in a compromised position too sat back too much on your toe Edge it's going to exaggerate back and try to crumple you and this flat-based stack over board position is your strongest position on your snowboard allowing you to get through that g pressure of the spoon with minimal problems so that's why we're trying to hit this flat Bas angle right through the spoon of the jump and once we get through that spoon that's when we're going and shifting to our heel Edge and then this is very important as you shift to your heel Edge that's when you want to go and do your wind up you don't want to be coming into a jump like right here fully closed off your shoulders wound up because that's going to be hard to keep that position and hold it you're blocking yourself so you only want to hit your maximum wound up position for a second before unwinding it this is the wind up and snap we're talking about and that's what gives you a lot of power so here you can see I'm in my neutral position relatively closed off and as I shift to my heels that's when I go and fully close off you can see it here with this backand winding up and as soon as I hit that maximum W position that's when I start throwing the spin and for throwing a spin it actually doesn't really matter how much power you put into a front free here we're not trying to snap it fast too slow it's not too important the speed in which you're snapping it's going to change for different tricks different features different things but what is super ridiculously crucial is making sure that you're continuing upwards momentum sideways momentum as you're going and leaving off the lip so for this I want you to pay close attention to my upper body here see how my upper body continues moving through the full duration until my tail snaps off the end what this does is it ch channels my rotational energy I use this metaphor before but it's my favorite one for it think of a drill super powerful spinning as long as you're holding the button but as soon as you let go it stops instantly the same principles apply to your snowboarding as you're going and generating that frow with your upper body it's going to continue that momentum but if you halt it for any point it's going to completely stop it so if I stop my snap right here and held this position as my tail was snapping off the end I actually wouldn't have any rotation momentum because your rotational momentum is only as powerful as it is as you snap off the lip so if you need more power you want to be hitting that maximum point of extension as your tail snaps off less power you want to be hitting that maximum point of extension as your tail snaps off still but you're doing it slower so that's how you get more power not by overthrowing your upper body but instead by making sure that your timing's perfect so you can continue that rotational energy as you snap off the Jump and now this is where we're getting Tech and people really start messing up the front side spin uh and that is over snapping the upper body so this is a really good snap position chest squared body aligned head forward this is a way enough what a lot of people will do though is they'll try to pull their upper body all the way around getting them super duper twisted up and that's going to make it so your legs need to play catchup uh we don't have an example of that right here but I do a lot of videos on that topic so check out the channel if you want to learn more about that we'll use this front seven here for example of how to get power and how you closed off your upper body should be as you leave off a takeoff because I think this is going to really trip a few of you guys out so here we have a front seven nose grab off of a very small jump nose grabs really slow down the rotation of the trick so the fact that we're doing it on a small jump with a nose grab means I'm using almost my maximum power and you can see I'm sacrificing a little bit of my form I'm letting my board scrub out the takeoff pre-s spinning a little bit and helping me continue the force the reason why we're doing this isn't just because we're unpatient but it's actually because I'm trying to get more rotational energy cheap a spin well keeping my upper body aligned with my legs here so this is a way that you can actually go and generate more Force while keeping your hips connected is letting yourself pre-spin a bit ideally in a perfect world you go and get a straight snap you don't go and have any form of a drift but there's an acceptable amount of drift and I'd say this is the limit to what's acceptable and it's around I don't know a 45 degree angle because here I'm still getting maximum pressure off my tail I'm still flat base leaving off and I'm still keeping everything aligned but if I went and had my board completely sideways in 90 then you wouldn't be getting that height and snap off your tail because you'd be taking off of your whole board at the same time so the max amount of pre-spin you can use is the max amount you can use with still making sure that you snap off this tail and now when we look at this front side snap this form you can see that my head is still positioned forward and my upper body isn't going pulling the rotation too much heads forward Hands Across the body and that's because front side rotations you're trying to go and make sure that your head is looking at the knuckle of the jump through the full duration of the spin so you lose it a little bit on a 720 there but then I immediately spot it again at this point I keep my head locked in on that point through the full duration of the jump and that's what sets you up to finish in this blind landing position this is the last thing we'll talk about here so I don't make this video ridiculously wrong long but that's a really important part people miss with their back ones front freeze any trick that utilizes the blind Landing they try to go and take their head and w wrap it around your shoulder trying to pull and cheat into seeing that Landing sooner uh I'm going to actually just make myself big here for one moment because I think this is really important to demonstrate when you're going and snapping a spin it makes sense to go and try pull everything around and pull that spin but what it does is it elongates your body makes it so your legs are falling behind so you actually need to pull your whole torso and upper body back around to have it catch up so if I go and snap my spin like this trying to get all the way across it's going to make it so my legs are lagging behind so I have to actually use counter rotation to bring everything back in line that's why when we're doing a spin we want to snap it and make sure our chest is St staying Square straight at the jump not relying on over twisting over leading with the head to get a rotation around but instead of a wind up and snap timing to get that power will let you keep your head forward so fat in mind let's really break down what's happening on this front side 360 I'm going and taking off having my upper body continue rotating as my tail snaps off the end with a flat base and then I'm keeping this head right here pointed forward and my chest forward to the jump 90 degrees that is the money Zone have your head Ro have your chest rotated more than 90 degrees and it's going to go and start making you not be able to hold that constant spot because right here I'm spotting the knuckle and I don't rotate my head around instead I let my body rotate around my head so my head position here is staying ridiculously still super clean and that's all coming from a takeoff I see in front of me where I'm going and I let my body rotate around that point finishing that blind Landing here you'll notice some Landing looking forward we won't talk about this too much but that's because the only reason you're using blind Landings is to kill your rotational momentum so if you manage to kill your rotational momentum throughout the rotation you can actually land looking forward with very minimal risk to yourself so we're going to just go and wrap this up now because this should be enough detail to really get you started on these uh so here you can see that I'm in a Crouch down position but I'm actually trying to go and pop up and extend up this is because if you try to go and spin off a jump with this bending your legs it's going to put pressure onto your heel Edge and when you have pressure on your heel Edge and you try to jump off it it's going to push you backwards you can go and feel this around just at home try to do a jump off of your heels you're going to get pushed back so even if your line is completely straight if you're going and jumping off your heel Edge you're going to get a bit of drift and that's why as we're extending for the pop we're trying to go and get ourselves more and more over the center of our snowboard so I actually go from more lean back to more stack and a great way to visualize this that I was told training in Japan is to think of doing your front side spins like a hard way because even though we're leaving off the heel Edge at the point of finally leaving the jump you want to be as flat based as possible and the best way to get into this is trying to set up your upper body over your toe Edge so it feels like you're doing a Hardway spin but with the heelside approach and that's a great way to have your power get generated to put you more up instead of across because this way you can go and push your whole Force downwards without it going push you back allowing you to get this Max extension off the lip and when you combine that with a good upper body timing I can't stress this enough what's important here is making sure that your body's upper body is continue momentum as you snop off the end and your head positioned straight you'll be able to go and hold your head there let your body rotate and everything will come around Supernatural we have a few more things we could talk about with like using your hips getting them engaged because we're not only throwing our upper body on this but we're throwing our whole hips all everything together the point of going and getting this takeoff and getting this snap is to snap off the lip with as much tail extension and body extension as possible while keeping everything tight so that way instead of trying to go and play catchup of your body trying to readjust instead you can just tighten it and if you want to speed up your rotation just pull into it and tighten everything more increasing your rotation velocity with a good takeoff with a good setup carve you can always speed up the rotation so focus on getting that straight takeoff continuing that energy being channeled with the upper body and if you do this successfully you will have an amazing front side takeoff I have places to improve I want to go and get onto my tow Edge sooner so I have a less drastic wishy-washy right there and that should hopefully let me consistently keep a cleaner Edge and keep more power so yeah let me know if there's some topics on front side spins I didn't cover here it's pretty hard should go and do it all in my head in one take here uh but those should be the key points so what I'd recommend you doing your writing is get your friends to film your front side takeoff compare it to this video compare it to your favorite pros and see how they differ if you can do that and spot the differences you'll be really able to streamline your riding because it's so hard just being like Oh I'm drifting oh I'm doing this but going and looking like am I drifting because I'm putting too much heel pressure am I drifting because I'm going and turning off the jump am I opening my chest too soon am I keeping myself too closed am I going and tilting my head am I looking over my shoulder those are the things you want to watch out for and feel for it's not if you landed a trick or not it's what aspect of the trick felt right and what aspect felt like it could be changed and the best way to do that is a video so give that a go let me know how it goes and we'll go and continue to pump out content like this thank you for joining me today and we'll be back at it with another video soon have a good one",

      "fullText": "You just won't have the range of motion to utilize it. This is the contrast to that position. See how my upper body is completely centered in my snowboard? My hips are squared and just everything's connected and tight. This position, while strong and sturdy, doesn't have any flexibility or move moability. So, I would never be able to go and squat down nearly that low. So, when I want to squat lower, use more range of motion, I shift the hips back exactly like you're seeing here. See how the knees are pulling back, the upper body is pulling forward. So, my center of balance is still over that same centered point, but I'm getting there with the contrast of the hips back, chest forward. This is what opens up the possibility of fast edge changes and fluidity throughout your motion. Because when you're going and keeping yourself completely centered and squared, you are now only moving on an up and down spectrum. Shifting the hips back doesn't only increase your up and down range of motion, but it also increases how much you can open your upper body. This makes it so you can drop lower, see where you're going more, and utilize not only up and down, but also rotational energies in order to elongate and put more power through any single turn you do on your snowboard. If we look at this posture here, we can see he's very tall and set over his front foot. This makes it so he's lifting up his back foot. And when this is useful in some instances, it's only useful with actual range of motion. So, the reason why this rider feels so stiff and uncomfortable is because his hips are shifted forward instead of backwards and he has a tall body. That's a really big part about this is you need to make sure that you have your upper body hinged forward in order to go and pull those hips back because if you're straight like a starecrow, you're not going to be able to go and start moving these body parts independently to one another and that means you won't be able to channel motion. This technique right here almost looks textbook. Her upper body's hinged forwards. There's a little bit of bend in her back leg and more extension in the front leg. The problem is she's rotating her chest too drastic for how much bend she has in her legs. This is because she's trying to go and get preempia heel side turn. But she would have naturally flown into that turn if she simply kicked those hips back more, letting her go and keep this upper body hinge, but with the correlation of the legs being pulled back. So slightly shifting the hips back is the difference between this girl doing a more advanced turn compared to her very beginner level snowboarding. This is a more intermediate level rider and we can really see it in action. Notice how his upper body and legs are completely centered over his snowboard. He doesn't have any back and forth mechanics going.",

There's two things that we need to make sure we're doing every single front side spin. First, hyper exaggerating our upper body position. On a backside spin, this is natural because we're up here rotating and we can do it from a very tall position, rotating all the way through. Front side, it's not that easy. We need to go and hyperexaggerate this. Most people get this problem because we're used to taking off on their heels. So, we'll pop off straight, slightly set over the heels. But what we actually want to be doing is spinning as if we were spinning hard way on the So that means we're setting our weight all the way over our toes and then exaggerating it.",

      "fullText": "Hey shredders, I'm very excited for this trampoline series. In it, I'm going to completely revolutionize how you use a trampoline and how you're able to go and effectively go and train all of your snowing tricks starting with straight airs going all the way up to 720s. We're going to start with this introduction video and this is just going to cover the absolute basics of what you need to know before going and trying any tricks on the trampoline. So, first things first, how do you fall on one of these things? When falling on you want to really make sure that you're not going and jamming your arms into the for very soft surfaces so you're able to just go and sling up flat on your side. So I want you before trying any tricks is just get comfortable with going and coming up and rolling to your back. The more you can get to your back, the safer it'll be. So if I'm trying to learn like a 360, I mess up. Woo! I just tuck in and get on my back. It's when you go and stick out your limbs that you can go and get injuries. But other than that, these things are pretty much injury proof as long as you don't go and hit any limbs in any weird ways. The next thing that's really important is your actual bounces. These are your foundation and they work just like your straighter on your snowboard. So, when we're going and bouncing on the trampoline, we need to make sure we're doing a couple things. First, we're not trying to fully juice every single bounce up in the air. When I fully juice, I extend my legs, extend my core, and that's going to make it so I'm overextended and have a weak position.",

      "fullText": "[Music] transition [Music] woohoo in this video we're going to go and give you the full walkthrough experience of riding side hits on crystal the best side hit lift across the whole mountain and we're just going to look around I haven't been on this lift all all year so I'm not too sure what's available and what's going to be trickable side hits are always changing and because of that you need to be on it you need to be vigilant and follow the proper steps so here we got a little bump we can o up boost into that transition or things like that we're just trying to hit the transition as smooth as possible a car spe around this corner and we're looking right now we're just searching I don't know what we're going to ride today but we're going to find some do stuff to ride no doubt a little bit of how to start the day there's a side hit coming up here I know for a fact but you need a bit more speed for so we'll carry that speed and my transition looks a little far so let's go and take it boost it there's a little transition to pocket here we don't want to pop too much because we have these bumps right after but side hits are all about using the terrain to the most and riding for it you can't do more and you can't do less than what the side hit wants these little ridges with so bunches pop up get a little bit of snow so for something of no Landing we want to pop up early hit that transition G this a little Valley and we're just hunting right now let's go this out uh this looks sendable yeah so this is a good flat takeoff we'll be able to pop an OE plenty of Landing we'll hit that next slap okay here we got a big boosting side hit uh there's a nub on the landing that we're going need to miss so I'm going going and go dead straight and try to Gap it and we'll start off with a straight there so coming in lots of speed oh no right on top of it oh cut over ride office no pop because there's no Landing o so looks like uh this way oh this slash is going to be good so fun nice oh this thing's good get a little pow on the way up so this Cliff has a couple options you could send it off here uh you need to drop in way higher from here but I should be able to hit this little Ridge uh I only have speed from here so hopefully it'll be enough actually I'm going hop up a little bit that just doesn't look like enough speed and there's plenty of Landing so that means I can go faster the better so one sec Max I'm just going to hop up all right dropping in three two one pop it nice oh let's see what's up here we're spicy Zone here Max love it it I think just straight off this line hey so I'm just now spotting for any Landing any pieces of soft snow to ride into uh there's some trees on the right and there's a bit of rough so I'm going need to go and take a straight line and point it I don't want to pop off this one I just want to go casual Cruise crawl off so I'm going preemptively position my board into the angle I want and I'm going just drop in just casual fun ooh Some Cliffs over here so here we have a little pill field so I'm going to try air off this hit that pillow been transition to a right of Max I need a little more speed so let me just hop up a bit I'm just trying to scope the line and it's right beside that tree so whenever you're ready Max so go and try hug that tree angle towards the pillow pop up woo a little more crusty under B I was expecting I was expecting to punch in but I hit solid so I would have needed to be a little more ready over my board left yeah we'll just boost this so this good Landing 7 cm just carry speed launch it pop a controlled amount and right into uphill so first we're going to try just go right over a bit of snow killing speed but this hit right here looks awesome pop it that hits so good nice take off plenty of Landing we'll go and be able to get some tricks on that on powder and into powder Landings you really don't want any extra angles any extra approaches so you're trying to go and set one angle and maintain that angle through the whole motion through the whole pop and that's just going to be way more consistent because if you go get on an edge start turning last second it's going to thr off your balance and that's not going to be good for trying to land through rough terrain that was a good lap went and got a lot of mental notes of how to go and actually ride beside hits we're riding today and we're going to use those to hopefully get some sick grabs this run so we can get a little bit of power on the way down here [Music] and we want to go straight bomb from here last time we went a little slow there is less on a takeoff now so it shouldn't be as slow oh so we almost boosted that absolutely to flash but we hit transition we'll need to go a little bit slower next run sorry I couldn't hear you under all the Steep stuff oh it's all good that was that was huge dude it's so deep right now on the side hits too bad it's not deep in The Landings uh here maybe we can hit us a little vertical oh only if I knew how to hand plant we're going to go through here see if we can hit anything it's a little bumpy and there bumping in the landing so I don't want to boost off every roller because High chance of landing on an uphill slope so let's go through here and see what we can find first little power bridge I think we're going to settle for just a little bit of pal yeah no nothing let's go carry speed through so we're coming into this side hit with probably not enough speed so I'm going to try air higher hit more transition oh yeah perfect oh I I thought I was so bone be but just hit the perfect pocket of snow that's a pretty lofty side hit uh that was awesome let's keep going that was sick little bumps here roll it keep it flow always just looking for that little bit of Landing little bit of transition oh we got enough speed to do a good pal slash yeah so this time we're going to go and boost down that slope since it's a flat takeoff what I want to do is OE on that angle if a takeoff doesn't have any kick you can generate all that pop through yourself so let's go and carry some speed so here I'm preemptively setting my angle pointed right at that zone I was talking about all the up W no yo oh that was bigger than I thought you good dude side hit report okay I full came off that one I didn't analyze the run in as much as Tavis did tried to do a little no pop push down didn't pop actually landed on a little bit of flat and just you'll see little blowout there everybody but we're good so recovering from that uh disaster me and Max both looked before we leaped Fair yet we didn't look very good apparently and mat just shows you there's variables for side hits that you won't be able to accommodate for that you won't be able to see that I did not expect the landing to be that short and that little bit of uphill pitch and apparently if you land on it it sucks firstand account uh we missed the side hits we did last lap some of them so we're going to check up right here and see if there's anything dope sir there's a little bit of snow so that's promising on track and let's just appreciate how empty it is up here there's no one around oh we can just go and launch off this into a p slash oh big snow it's awesome today guys it's awesome even just the cords even just the cords yeah let's oh my godo oh yeah back to this boy all right we're here again we got pretty much perfect speed last time and this time we have even more speed because it's tracked out uh whenever you're ready Max we'll try hit a nose grab so patient pop get a good air nose grab right into a transition oh back let's see if there's another possible Line This is even worse unless oh dude I can do it so this one I'm not sure how much of a takeoff but I think I can just air right over this tree land in this pocket and I'll be perfect going preemptively angle my board straight pop down a little bit of snow so I have more speed let's do it little tree bog let's go check out these CP again yeah dude Max said there is something good to the left so we're going to go scul her oh right onto that pillow here yeah who I know oh dude I know you can transfer up there over that bridge but the problem is if you fall into that Gap you die so here we have a little small Cliff uh no Landing so we're not going to want to pop we're going to use the approach of leaning back trying to get as close to the ground as possible to hopefully absorb is there anything I need to Gap in the landing Max no it looks pretty good all right so I'm literally just going to preemptively angle my board this way and I'm going to like roll in sort of like back foot and that lets me drop nice and low gets ready for my jeez let's hit this with a little more speed there we go that's nice and has way more success navigating that section Miss slap and last I want to do one more hit on here because I'm not confident of Landing but it's a great takeoff great pop so I'm going to hit it just right off the corner and see how it feels we'll go backx speed to woohoo nice that was awesome important note for riding side hits like this is this is about as good as it gets plenty of snow plenty of base and then a little bit of fluff on top it could be a little bit deeper but you couldn't just show up any day of a week at Whistler and do side hits like this like there's a reason why this is the day I'm doing it and yeah you need to be smart you need to be careful there's Max is landing right there right where it starts getting uphill not where you want to land nope and yeah I landed not much better I yeah so it turns out there like 2T of transition on that one uh don't boost it looked better than it was looked better than it was not going to lie guys this one's a bit of a gamble I don't really know the speed I've overshot and undershot and the snow the speed changes every time especially when spinning so this back free normally you should hike it get more control on the speed but we're filming a YouTube video so we're going to push it a little bit we're still going ride with pal way in all right so I want to be really calm really light on my Edge improvise you knuckle you improvise that's a rule of side hits because I felt like that was pretty sey even so way too slow I got scared but we survived oh let's try hit this thing again this thing's really icy so I'm going need to really get ready to absorb oh that's so vertical so around the same speed as last time it's just a little flat I know if this is a side hit video but how could I not when it's nice and soft like this you can dig in your Edge as much as you want it's going to just let you drive so much power you can see I'm literally popping out of these turns and that's just W oh oh too much juice I saw this I'm like I want it ah tried to turn faster my body was ready this isn't a good cord lap a half down there maybe do something o yeah I like how you're thinking Max I like how you're thinking a lot these ridges are fun to slash though oh that's bumpy what a half pipe wa as if they just have a hidden halfpipe oh my God look at this wall what half fight's back at Whistler and no one's told me what the hell yeah wh hell yeah this snow isn't quite as good you can hear it's a little icy can I get up here no oh yeah I have no idea where we are now we can go boost this little roller not much going on let's go hit it with a slash and an ollie nice uh we're going to try a front free here but landing's a little bit a little bit Landing es uh so what I'm going to do is take off a little bit further to the left planning on drifting a little bit because the take off softer and just float it uh you want to SP spot a little bit looking forward but you can only do that if you get the right pop so basically just try to stay calm on the edge and trust that uh all my work will lead me to my feet oh so not the route I wasn't actually able to go take off where I was planning on taking off because it was a little soft a little angled so I had to cut it short so we landed n of the transition was looking for for but it makes a make the side hits are good but I'm honestly not feeling the spins right now there's a few funky things in The Landings a couple funks in the takeoff that's making a little sketch so we're just going ride enjoy it because that's what side hits are all about sure pushing yourself but also just having a great time on the mountain cruising with friends so let's freaking charge two to make it true okay too slow again oh powder savagery oh can I hit this oh man what a nice day okay we're going to try to take a little more speed try to hit a fresh Zone almost would be better to start from there but I'm feeling a little faster this run I think we're going to get get it same spot again same spot I think that time I went a little too quick and got bucked so I couldn't get the kick ah couldn't get the transition that's okay though we'll get over this way maximum just enjoy some of these cords oh my God this day is so blessed c one so this time that Landing got a little bit bad going big so we're going to hit it slower do a little casual c one maybe so go to switch and same principles taking the angle popping off the nose and yeah that Landing is super flat go over here post up so this one has that bump in v any want to clear so straight speed should be enough and yeah let's just pop up see if we can feel comfortable in the air off this thing oh no a damn that's why I didn't want to do a flip or something on it because I was worried that might happen let's carry mad speed into a spur [Laughter] oh we'll go hit this thing one more time it's awesome whoa are you planning falling off this no I'm going to side okay sick all right this thing is really good right now speed's perfect from here to go straight good takeoff so just fall through be relaxed make sure no one's in the way and let's do it so here we have a super narrow Landing Strip so I'm going to preemptively set my angle and I need to make sure to not go too far to the left or else clip into that pillow uh if there's a bit more snow we could actually ride into that pillow but it's just not the day so this one's a little sniper all right let's do it Yoo that was awesome a little less risk but still just as much fun match the angle don't pop off too much right into that Transit right out a little flat there but that's pretty fun I could see was some proper pal but yeah there's definitely like a line if you hit bat and transferred over yeah dude bunch of potential bunch of pensil first time seeing it so didn't get anything too stey but Zone unlocked oh this is sort of nothing but we'll drop into it so something like this completely flat just be ready get ready for that g out oh the left glute and is a beautiful day out here oh what's this thing that was so buot gra oh Road Gap oh no way well it's way smaller than I thought it was anyone hitting it yeah massive Gap one of the classic side hits of a mountain uh the Gap itself isn't that big with a drop it's pretty straightforward with a speed the issue is the landing is chewed out so like I don't think there's any Landing off the snowboard right now yeah baby get that dog get that yeah bro I know you got it [Music] [Applause] bro holy bro what the yeah dude that was massive yeah bro that's L bro yeah uh what made you want to hit that thing well it's my friend skier friend up there and uh he talked to me last night I was like hey Sam you got a you got to hit this man this is like the best cliff in the mountain at black I was like okay and I was like maybe you want to hit it first I will see it and then maybe I will try it and then he's like okay I'm going to go first man yeah and then he went for it it was looks good and then okay I'm going to do it yeah so you didn't scope it out or anything you just pull it up up top and like it's good well if I'm looking down from here I'm probably not going to do it so did you scope out from the top of the in run or did you just like it's good I'm hitting it I just scope from right up there no way and then I was like okay I know the speed I reveal his video okay let's go for it yeah what gave you the confidence that it was going to work out well I trust my friend there like I talked to him about the snow conditions how was the landing how was the impact he's like it's good man you're going to make it uh how important is it on like sending Cliffs and stuff like trusting your friends like because obviously you didn't scope it out so like oh we uh we worked up from like small Cliffs all the way to this one yeah we did hit hit a few smaller ones this morning and then we were warm up and then we go for this one very cool dud congratulations safety major that was awesome I think he literally boosted like 80 ft down like that's more air time in Shack left I'd say that was huge rations thanks man two one drop it yes all that was [Music] huge yeah dude where you so that was Ridiculousness both those boys sent it so much honestly I don't think either of them had any chance of Landing that but they sent it anyway and that's really what powder side hits are all about and it goes to show you when you're riding with blackholm there's always someone doing something more gnarly so stay humble and have fun",

      "fullText": "every turn in snowboarding is based around leverage in order to get a deeper carve you need to increase the leverage on your Edge think of your board as a car jack with your body's purpose to increase the leverage needed to add weight onto your Edge the only difference is you have multiple different ways you can get this leverage when snowboarding and in this video you're going to learn all of them let's start with a classic leaning leaning is when you lean either forward or backwards this adds more pressure onto your Edge by concentrating your weight onto a smaller Point think about it like this The Leverage of holding your board is pretty easy to move when it's like this you can shift it adjust it pretty light but if I go and shift it to the bottom oh that board becomes incredibly heavy and I can't really go and do anything about it this is the same principle we're using when we're leaning on our turns because holding it from the end increases the lever arm making gravity exert more torque so it feels heavier and harder to control this is the same reason leaning adds more pressure to your Edge there are two things to note about leaning one they rely on momentum if you stand still and try to lean you won't get very far before falling forward but you can lean much further when snowboarding this is because speed increases a snowboarder stability due to the way the forcers interact with the board and the snow at higher speeds the board creates more Force against the snow which increases the pressure and enhances the grip this can help the edge of the snowboard dig into the snow offering more stability and traction allowing continue to lean much further than if you weren't moving two the more you lean the more your center of mass is shifted away from your snowboard this makes it so if you hit any icy patch or bump you're much more likely to have your legs kick out from under you resulting in a fall what brings us to the second way to turn your snowboard putting pressure into your boots and bindings since your boots are stiff you can use them to add leverage think about it as using a stick to try leverage a door open because the stick is firm you can add pressure onto one end in order to add leverage to the other your boots and highbacks work in the same way by shifting your knees forward it puts more pressure onto the tops of my boots and because the boots are relatively stiff it adds more pressure to the tow Edge allowing you to increase of amount of edge pressure while keeping your weight over your board for heel side this is where forward lean comes into play forward lean is referring to the angle of your bindings the more forward lean the more leverage you get the faster it is to activate that Leverage so too much will make it so your turns are touchy and not enough will make it so your turns are slower because they have less leverage and activate slower but brings us to number fre opening your hips opening your hips puts pressure onto your Edge by utilizing torsion when I open my hips I push my back toes down as I lift my front toes this makes it so the board warps making it so the back toe Edge digs in as the front of my board is more flat based this lets me hold Edge pressure without my board trying to turn this is why torsion is used a lot on things like back side spins because you want Edge pressure while maintaining a straight line for heel side your front toes go down and your back toes go up this one I find very challenging and lastly we have driving into a turn sometimes called pushing or loading this is a blanket term that's basically referring to using the bend in your legs to increase or decrease the pressure on your Edge as you squat down this condenses your weight and when you condense or load your body weight onto your Edge it increases your Edge pressure and when you stand up or jump it decreases the pressure in your Edge or otherwise known as unweighting your Edge so you load and unload the pressure over your Edge in order to add more traction and decrease your traction the faster you do this motion the more drastic the results this is because the speed of your movement adds Force you're putting into your Edge that's why if you hold yourself in a bent down position it's not going to give you that much extra Edge pressure but as you load into into that position you'll build more and more pressure and as you unwe your Edge it becomes lighter and as you add a little extension or hop into there you get a moment of weightlessness what lets you really swap edges all these techniques work best in correlation of one another because your balance is based on momentum you need to build your momentum before you can get into deeper positions if I try to enter a mad carve right away I won't have enough momentum to hold it but as I get deeper and deeper into my turn it actually accelerates me making me more stable allowing me to get deeper into the turns so when turning follow these steps first set your Edge this can be light I generally use a stack position to get this first bit of edge pressure and from there you can add some lean open the hips load your Edge push into your shins and when you do all these fluently and connected you'll be truly carving like a pro and thank you so much for watching",

      "fullText": "I think it's because I'm looking for the landing too soon. I'm trying to pull into the spin probably because I'm scared. I want to get the spin around. I'm trying to like lead and look into it too soon. Uh let's go and just rewind a little bit. So, I'm coming up winding, throwing, and then immediately coming in and keeping my upper body pulling there where he's letting his upper body catch up. Oh, yeah. Look at that. So, spotting head looking forward, body catching up, and then whipping it through where I'm going and throwing it, throwing, throwing, throwing, and then catching and just continuing it through. Like you can see a little bit of a whip, but I'm my head and everything's already here versus dead center, looking straight at the knuckle. Wow. And then continuing that snap the whole way. Interesting. That's probably why these guys are getting so much more rotational power than me. Uh, okay. I'll try to explain this as best I can. This is like really high level stuff for me. So, I'm still pretty beginner at it. But see how I go and snap my spin and my head is remaining in a very stationary position over ext over my shoulder here. So, as I'm at 90° here, my shoulders like already tucked in, chins down towards my back leg. This is making it so I'm actually slowing down my momentum a bit because everything's catching up and staying together. I'm not really like taking my upper body and continuing the throw. A good example for this is when people do backside 360s and they rotate their chest and lower body all connected. I'm basically snapping and then having everything all connected and keeping it all connected. But by going and delaying pulling the upper body into this, watch this. He's going and snapping doo. the board's catching up and the board's still creating momentum. It's still channeling that momentum. And then as soon as the board catches up, he then continues his upper body pulling through. So, it's going and like building off that momentum and sort of like teeter tottering. So, upper body's generating momentum. Then, he's going and flexing everything together, making his legs go faster. And once it catches up, he's now going and tightening his core and pulling his head into that spin. So, he's going and initiating that second part, getting the vortex going uh secondarily. So, I'm snapping and after I snap, I'm immediately going and pulling into the vortex where he's going and giving it a second to breathe, extend, and then tightening and contracting the muscles. And that's actually giving him a second round of acceleration. And not only is that giving him a second round of acceleration, it's also going and making sure that his axis rotation is more flat because instead of immediately pulling into his grab and pulling into everything and getting towards that back foot, instead he's flat, patient, and from here he's able to go and determine that pull. And that's letting him get a lot more clean pressure. When you go and try to like pull into your pressure and pull into your form too soon, it has the potential of going and exaggerating your mistakes. So here if I went in like pot.",

      "fullText": "all of rail riding is based off of one principle that principle being you want to maintain a stack position as consistently as possible throughout the full duration of the feature this is because when you're stacked over your board maintaining the same balance point you won't have any risk of slipping out or going and flopping around the issue comes from every single thing you do on a rail will try to break this position if you do a backside board slide you're going and popping up what's going to try break your position counter rotating what's going to shift your position so we need to go and accommodate for that in order to do this we do a bunch of pre- steps and have a bunch of little subtle techniques making it so it's way easier to hold a stack position increase a range of motion without going in overextending and compromising it so that's what we're going to cover in this video all the little tricks and tips that Pro snowers use in order to make rails simplified easier to approach and much safer and more consistent so let's get right into it first let's quickly break down what a stack position is a stack position is referring to your balanced position that you can go go and move your full range up and down sideways back and forth whatever while maintaining your center of balance over your board so here because I'm using my stack position principles I'm able to go and Crouch down infinite that's because I'm keeping my weight set over the balls my feet so that's what's letting me go and squat down this much if we go and look at something like a 50/50 with a more proper form we'll see that it's a lot more subtle I'm just going and making sure that my legs have a little bit of Bend we need a little bit of Bend in our legs because that's going let us extend abtract uh meet the rail uh and when we Bend our legs a bit it's going to make it so our butt goes out when our butt goes out we need to have our upper body come forward because our goal is to maintain our balance set over the balls of our feet that's like the little bit before your toes the reason why you want to balance here instead of like flat based or the heels is this is just your Natural Balance position think about jumping off your feet or anything you're using the balls of your feet in order to determine most of your balance and that's true even when you put snowboard boots on so stack position is basically referring to a body position that you feel comfortable in can hold neutrally and you're able to go and hold your stack position by able to use your full range of motion while maintaining your balance over that same point doing that makes you master the stack position but everything you do on a rail will try to break this so as I go and come onto a rail and I go and oie vat making it so I need to extend my legs if my legs are extending it's going to extend my upper body and vat going to make it so it's harder to go and maintain the same balance point over my feet same with getting onto the rail going and matching the rail linking up will also try to shift this momentum and try to shift me out of my stack position the first thing that we use to make rails a lot easier is something called angle of approach your angle of approach is referring to the angle you're taking towards the rail the reason why we're taking a little bit of the angle towards the rail is because we need to go and travel distance in order to get on top and we want to have a little bit of angle helping with that because if we're just going dead straight we'll need to go and jump forward and the bigger jump we do the more it's going to break our positioning so your angle is going to vary a lot depending on speed and that's because it syns up with the rail the faster you go and the lower the rail and the steeper the takeoff the less angle you need that's because your goal for your angle should be so you syn up to the rail perfectly by the time you go and get onto it so here I go and have a light angle like maybe 15 degrees and then I'm using that angle because in correlation to the speed I have it goes and puts me right on top of the rail there's a few more little small things that go into this foow but first is Edge pressure we really don't want to be digging in our Edge in order to go and get onto the rail because that's going to make us hook increasing the pressure in and increasing the sideways momentum because even though we need sideways momentum to get onto the rail rails are slippery surfaces so once you're on them if you have sideways momentum and you don't stop it you're going slide off so what we do here to compensate for that is making sure to come in on a relatively flat base the only Edge pressure you want is the slight bit of traction you get from holding the slight Bend in your legs in your stack position and that will be all the edge pressure you need so here you can see I'm pretty much completely flat-based so instead of thinking about turning into a rail think about shifting your hips your upper body and your legs all matching that angle so instead of going and trying to turn into it instead you're treating it as if this is straight downhill on this slight angle and that's going to decrease momentum the next little trick we do is something called setting our weight over the rail this is placing our upper body in a position so it's already set in the stack position that will be in on the rail so right here before takeoff you can see how my upper body is slightly more leaned forward towards the rail than my lower body is this is making it so as I come into the rail my upper body is hardly traversing at all making it so I'm having less weirdness when I'm trying to move having your upper body preemptively over a rail will make it so your upper body is traveling less distance less sideways momentum because only your legs are traveling that distance so here's a really good example I go and set my upper body over a rail this makes it with my angle so my legs are the only thing traveling so it's minimum sideways momentum and that lets me hold this position and land in that stack position how you can tell I land in a stack position here is because my weight is set over the balls my feet and because I'm in a stack position that makes it so I can go and activate Alles right after and that's how I get this balance and control getting onto that rail with that smooth position but there's a bit more that goes into it because Height plays a huge factor in all these variables as well that's why we're trying to get onto the rails with as little extra height as possible this has a few super beneficial effects first of all when you're going and getting onto a rail for Less height means less impact so here since I hardly had any height I hardly have any impact that means I'm not going to need to use my legs to absorb that impact allowing me to keep a more consistent position the way we do this is something called holding tail pressure on the takeoff this means instead of thinking about popping or alling onto the rail instead we're trying to keep our tail in contact with the takeoff as long as possible because that's going to make it so our nose is naturally over the feature and when your nose is naturally getting over the feature that's going to make it so with your angle of approach you naturally sink up onto it making it a way easier transition and that's going to give you way more movement for like all these out so here we're coming in and look at how little of a pop I'm doing and that's because I don't need a pop what because I'm making sure to maintain that tail pressure by going and thinking instead of trying to lift up instead think about just pushing prioritizing making contact will naturally put you into a very very over the top of a rail position you can see that I'm still extending my legs and I'm still popping but I'm prioritizing my tail making contact because that's going to put me naturally over the board and I'm not popping so much that it disconnects my upper and lower body and let's talk about that next how your popping needs to work in order to not go and overextend you here is the overextended pop I snap too much and that makes it so at this point here my upper body is completely straight if your upper body is completely straight your legs are completely straight it's going to make it so your core is in a weakened position this makes it so you have a moment where you don't have the ability to actually control your air time and the reason why this is so problematic is because it's not going to let you make micro adjustments for even just a couple milliseconds is enough to really thrill you off and that's going to make it way harder to go and pull everything in and land in that stack position so because I left off and let myself fully extend I landed in this fully extended stack position and if you're fully extended on your snowboard you won't have the bend in your legs needed to set your weight over the balls your feet this is making me land completely flat based and when you land flat based without that balanc position you're going to be more susceptible to like slipping off gripping over popping also has another problem outside of just going and throwing off your form it also makes it so you can't utilize something called the side of the rail whenever you're hitting a rail especially like a tube like this you want to do something called catching the rail because even with minimum sideways momentum you still will have a little bit that's why even though I popped up hardly traveled any distance hit the rail in a pretty smooth position I still slide off the end because I don't use the catching the rail principle you can still pop super high while maintaining a stack position here I'm getting Max extension pulling my legs up and tapping the end of the rail and I'm doing this by a couple of things first I'm making sure that I have my S balance point set during the full duration so as I go and pop up I never let myself pop up to a point where my upper body isn't slightly set over my toes so even at full extension my center of weight is set over the same point and that's really what I'm trying to go and teach you here is that you need to make sure that you're keeping your enter of mass set over the same point through your whole range of motion because I did this I'm able to then go and bring my legs up and as I bring my legs up I let my upper body come forward maintaining that same center point because I'm maintaining the same Center of balance it's first letting me go and move my legs wherever I want because we're not needed to go and correct uh my air control if you get a good pop and you maintain good balance you'll be able to go and do whatever shifts or twists you want because it's not going to be needed to go and try to maintain your balance position in the air but if you go and overextend over poop get a weird takeoff you're going need to use your arms your legs to rebalance and when you're rebalancing you won't have time to go and do any other motion a rebalance is a motion a backside board slide rotation is a motion it's all motions so when you're popping really think about going utilizing that tail coming up and using as little pop as you need so you can maintain the most balanced position as possible catching for rail is referring to going Landing with your board slanted into the side of the rail by Landing with your board into the side of a rail it's going to make it so you're going and killing your momentum by pushing your weight out this way we still want to have our weight set all the way over top of a rail this is just a tilt we do with our hips and if you go and maintain a stack position you can actually do these tilts in the hips without compromising your form here I'm coming in super far right side to the rail and that's going to make it so I travel more distance more distance traveled equals more sideways momentum in order to counter this I really angle my board into the side of a rail by tilting my hips as I do this I still have my upper body set mostly over top of a rail but you can see it's not fully on top of a rail and that's because you actually want to use sideways momentum and plan for it so here I'm not just going and trying to kill the sideways momentum but I'm getting ready for it to go and continue pulling my upper body back over the rail and this is a really important part of more advanced rail riding is using the sideways momentum to make the rails as small and as approachable as possible first let's go over a couple of instances where I'm using too much uh angle and not able to get my weight over rail right here see how my board's really angled this is actually okay the issue is my upper body is matching the angle and if my whole body matches the angle and I don't use that momentum to try Rock Me Over the natural thing that's going to happen is you're just going to not get fully on top of it and your time being on the rail will be limited here I'm hyper exaggerating that I'm going popping in and putting my whole body on the angle I'm putting my board on so angling the board completely up body's angled out because of this I have no weight set over top of a rail and with no weight set over top of a rail you're going to go where your weight is set in this case it's off to the left so this is why we want to use the angle and use the tip this is why when we're catching the rail we want to really make sure to utilize the hilt this is why when catching the rail it really should just be a tilt with the hips so here I'm coming in rotating tilting and look at how my board's Landing slightly angled to kill that momentum but when I'm doing that I'm keeping my upper body completely set over top of the rail and this is only really possible to do these micro hip movements if you're not going in overextending your legs so I want you to pay really close attention to my legs here see how I'm going and making sure that I'm maintaining contact with the snow that's putting my front foot naturally very over top of a rail making it so I don't really need to extend my legs and that's letting me rotate into his front board while maintaining a very solid upper body position and that lets me go and get that slight bit of angle to kill the momentum the more momentum I have the more I'll go and kill it and the more I'll plan for it to try pulling over a rail so here slam into of a side with a lot of angle but I put a lot of weight onto my front foot you can see how much my front legs let my front leg is bent and my back leg's extended this is because I'm setting all the weight over here because of that I have a lot of weight set over the center of the rail and that's going to make it so even though I'm landing with my board very angled at the start my weight's primarily set over top so that little bit of momentum that time it takes to kill the sideways momentum is rocking me over back to that centered position neutral me out in a no uh side momentum position and another thing that's really important when doing rails is trying to go and get your upper body as stationary as possible I want you to pay really close attention to my head positioning here see how my head is at this point at the end of the takeoff watch how much it moves throughout this backside board slide I'm trying to keep my upper body as level and stationary as possible ideally only my legs are changing height so my knees are going bent more bent but my upper body is staying stationary like on a trolley just zooming down or like a zip line or something your upper body is on the same platform here I'm going and popping a lot but I want you to go and watch my head position and upper and body I'm keeping it all very still and it's going more through the feature instead of up and then down this is because up and down isn't what you want on Rails it increases impact and it makes it so you can't use the side of a rail and when we're on the front lip this is the ultimate trick to use catching the rail on and really seeing it get demonstrated see how my board is just kicking into the side and really using that extra traction and force this is also what I'm talking about by the rail force of your sideways momentum will help you stay on the rail and rock over here my body isn't positioned completely over rail that's because I'm trying to get it completely blunted out but the reason why I'm able to hold traction is speed and momentum pushing me into the side of a rail and that's acting like you know you have a bucket of water you spin in Circle the water stays in the bucket it's sort of like this you have enough force on the surface in order to go and keep you locked into it and this is why bigger rails are actually easier for more advanced snowboarders because when we're going and blunting into a slide that's making it so we don't need to jump as high because I'm going get into a blunt I don't need to do the extra pop to get up and over the rail this is making it so I don't need to jump as much that means I don't need to extend my legs as much plus I have more range motion to go and kill my momentum blunts are also a great way to go and build snap and build power and that's why you see the pro snowboarders really going and blunting out those features getting on that one foot and just really like getting styly so it has the benefit of being practical and really useful but not and it helps for tricks oh sorry it has a benefit I'll try fix that and post if we OE at the front of the rail this is showing why these mechanics help so much here since we're alling at the front we need to rely on a full pop a full Flex of a board in order to get height because we can't rely on that takeoff to snap us up this is making it so I have to hyper exaggerate my upper body because I'm hyp exaggerating my legs going straight so to keep my balance it's really tough it's also making me pop like 8 ft before the rail because I'm popping 8 ft before the rail the rail is 8 ft longer and that's making it so when I get on the rail I have a lot of rail to slide it's also coming from the front makes it so you can't catch the side of a rail so here because I didn't go and hit the rail absolutely perfect I don't have any variables to go and change that so I'm going come off early and that's why rail takeoffs are actually your friend think of them as being just a little ride on feature like this rail here looks tall out of the ground but with the angle of its steepness and the angle of the takeoff it actually doesn't take take much pop I can just do a little pop that I'd want to do onto a box or something anyway is going to be enough to get me onto rail by using all the principles we talked about in this video we're going to demonstrate some of these principles with this clip here and then after that I'm going to do a recap just telling you all the keyn notes so you can go and incorporate them into your riding so this clip pretty wild pretty crazy I thought it was going to die at multiple points during it but it's a really great showing of Stack position so what happens here first I'm coming up and I'm using my tail pressure into the takeoff as long as possible having my upper body snap just like you would for a spin from here I'm utilizing something called counter rotation and that's where I'm rotating my legs and upper body in opposite directions in order to speed up the rotation of my legs this also has the beneficial factor of making it so your upper body is rotated one way or rotated back this way and because I'm doing a continued spin that's going to give me more range of motion to channel that energy through because rails don't let you grip so you need to make sure you're channeling that energy if I landed in a completely stacked position here that make it so I'd immediately be needing to go and generate that spin but by Landing with my upper body a little bit under rotated I can use my upper body to channel that rotation through that said I'm landing a little bit too tall with my weight set slightly too much over my toes we can see this with the upper body here and you can just sort of tell by the Vibes that the weight isn't perfectly set over the ball of the feet and this is problematic because as I try to add a more complex movement into it and try to rotate the spin my upper body comes more and more forward this is setting my balance all the way forward and because of that when I go on pop for 180 I'm coming in very very toe heavy and this is where a really cool principle of bean stat comes into play if you're toe heavy when you're 180° this way as you rotate a 180 your center of mass will be set set to the other point so here it gets set to my heels and this is going to be true for every single 180 every single board slide your center of weight your stack position shifts as you do 180s so as I do a 180 here my center of balance goes from being on the toes over to on the heels because of the angle of my body and in order to counter this we need to go and just make sure that we're ready for it we have our heelside stock position just is set and we're moving within it so here I'm like in a bad spot this whole time not looking good but as my board makes contact I go and pull my upper body straight through my chest this makes it so my center of balance is now saved and over top of my toes if I would have landed in any other position I would have slipped out heels first so the only way for me to recover and get to a stacked state was to go into his full sumo squat and here you can really see if you don't if you land completely stacked and you don't have any way to kill the momentum that's going to make it so you spin out uncontrollably and that's why I'm able to chew some out even though I'm in the worst position known to man and that's because I have momentum going and the rail just wants to carry that through then we end it with a little bit of counter rotation but through a through a whole range of motion of these tricks I'm trying to maintain that stack position here my upper body is in a nice stale position look at the bending my legs bending my my waist I'm going and reaching in mean of a rail catching it a little bit but I'm keeping that upper body set in generally the same spot and that's what's giving me all this control when you're catching the rail you'll want to go and meet your legs to it a little bit but not much the bigger you air on to it the more you'll need to meet it to absorb that impact because if you just land with bent legs you're just going to Boop and generally it's really hard to bend down further than like 90° while maintaining a stack position I'm very trained and I've did a lot of hot yoga with my mom when I was younger so I'm good at holding M acquisition to a very large range of motion but generally 90° squat is going to be people's limits so we want to be getting as little air on extending your legs a little bit not so much but it's fully extending it's all about maintaining that constant stacked form feeling comfortable not overextending not putting yourself in a position where you're uncomfortable think about how you ride a mountain you're trying to go and ride in a comfortable position where you're not feeling overextended you're not doing like a toe-side turn and trying to fully extend your body feel your core disconnect feel your arms get weak and have that moment of weightlessness loss of control instead you're trying to go and do every turn every speed check while maintaining that same balance point same control so you can get fluent motions a fluent motion is just a motion that doesn't have extra complications and the more variables you can remove from this the better so as a final recap the steps that every personal where uses on every single rail hit is first angle of approach making sure you're approaching that rail staying relatively flat-based in your stack position weight set slightly over the rail then making sure you're making contact with the takeoff as long as possible this naturally puts your board over the rail fully use as the feature making it so you don't need to rely on your legs to generate the height letting you do a smaller motion next you need to catch a rail this is done through tilting the hips slightly angling well keeping your upper body set over rail keeping powerful next you just keep your at stack position keep your head looking forward just like you were riding down a slope and from there you just hold that and ride off the end if you're feeling good you can add a ollie add a pop add a Shifty and then for the landing you just do the same thing you go extend your legs pop through ideally you're taking off in a stack position Landing in a stack position and that'll result in you being able to ride out in a stack position that's a little Deep dive in some of fundamental principles that are needed on every rail trick it gets more specific when we start breaking it down into like different tricks but these principles are the principles that every snowbo is using and basing the tricks around if you see a guy that can do every rail trick in the park learn a rail trick first try it's because he's mastered these fundamentals and that's allowing him to go and really tweak his writing adjust it to get more stylish and more control on the features so give these a go let me know how it goes and we'll be back with another video soon",

      "fullText": "So, most of your power here isn't being used for rotation and instead is being set down to the ground. And this is why your rotation is being cut short. So you're going and snapping your spin and then you're holding it in this downward arc. Because if you actually tried to follow through and throw snap your spin like I'm doing here on this angle, you would be going and throwing yourself straight front flip. And that's why we really need to get you taller because you're just not going to be able to put power into this position. So that's your issue. You're coming in, your setup carve isn't putting you in a position where you can get tall, open your hips, open your chest, and this is making you go and crunch over, lean forward, and as you try to add more power to your spin, your upper body is too hinged forward, causing too much of your momentum to be angled downwards. And this is causing you to get too flippy. And this too flippy of axis is making it so you can't hold the constant spot on the knuckle and then go and hold that rotation and pull all the way through. To fix this, first you need to practice at home. I want you to practice going and loading your weight onto your heel edge, opening your hips, opening your chest preemptively towards the corner of a jump and visualizing that you're looking at the corner of a jump. By angling our whole bo body towards the corner, it lets our hips open up more, our chest open up more, and that's going to give us more range of motion to play with.",

      "fullText": "in this video I'm going to completely change how you think about catching air on your [Music] snowboard the secret is you don't want to be lifting you actually want to be pushing pushing is how you get all of your power on your snowboard and that's what lets you get up get Transitions and really utilize everything so in this video I'm going to explain how you can change your mindset from lifting the body trying to lift your board up to going and pushing off that tail extending up letting you go and unleash the full power you have and your snowboard has so how snowboarding works is your tail of your snowboard acts as a little bit of a diving board bouncy gives you some spring gives you a lot of power and we want to use that power every single opportunity we have to go and make it so jumping takes as little extra energy as possible the reason why you don't want to jump off your board all at once is because that makes it so you don't fully utilize your tail so if I try to do like a jump here see how both feet lift this is going to limit your air time what you want to be doing is making sure to fully utilize the tail of your snowboard because that's going to give you so much more air just by coasting off and coming down and how this actually works is the steeper the transition the more you want to push off to go on counter that kick and this is true for doing spins as well we want to leap off that tail because it goes and increas inrees our air time giving us more time to go and transition our throw transition our power fully utilizing the feature here we got a little steep Ridge so I'm going to go push off a tail I'm not even doing a Allie I'm just trying to make sure that I'm maintaining contact with the tail my snowboard as long as I can off the feature push off a tail nice and steep this is a great one push off a tail try to hit that little bit of transition and I'm not actually using much force here I'm literally just trying to channel the energy in off that tail a really important note for this is when you're pushing you don't want to be pushing your body up you don't want to be lifting instead you want to stay compressed stack keep your core engaged and push through that board try really feel the full transition of the feature so pushing through feeling the full transition and that's what's going to give you maximum height but smaller of the feature of a more this is going to exaggerate your height because if you're hitting like a 2ft feature then that extra board length of using your tail is going to make the feature feel an extra 2 ft long versus if you're just trying to pop up both feet at the same time you're not using your board you're not fully using the feature making it so you're not fully utilizing your power and this is really true when it comes to allies when you're doing allies it's not about trying to explod off that tail as aggressively as possible instead is trying to get your timing set so you can go and smoothly transition and push off it while keeping your core and upper body connected so it looks like this a little smooth motion and this smooth Move Motion is what keeps everything together we don't want to be going leaning back and trying to keep our whole body pushed back instead we want to go and keep our weight relatively centered shift to the back foot and as we go and extend our legs we move our upper body back over so it's sort of like this motion here think about like pumping a feature you're coming up and pumping like this so see how as I go and squat down my weight goes back and as I go up my weight goes forward this is a push forward motion but we're looking for and this is how we go and get that power and stay in control on our Edge we're going to get into a few more side hits here to demonstrate it on the heel side because this is a lot easier on the toes sets you more over the balls your feet cuz you pop but over the heels the same principles apply this also gives you a lot more control because instead of relying completely from the power of your legs aren't to get popped instead you're also relying from a power snowboard so I can go pop up a little bit earlier if I want to get less power more transition it's like this doesn't have much Landing so I'll alllie a little early so I can still land in that transition so you don't need to go and ride off the feature every time it's all about getting that right angle giving the right power and running a feature for what it is one pop isn't going to work for every single kind of jump every single kind of side hit but they're all using the same fundamental principles of trying to push through a jump instead of trying to lift your legs up once you can fully unlock pushing through that snowboard chaning that energy through the tail and just exploding off it you'll be able to get so much more power so much more control it's going to make side hits jumping everything just so much more fun if

      "fullText": "we're driving to the slopes got a Ride saving me about a trillion dollars so this is my MVP of the trip right here absolute hero we're going to be riding the big airbag today that's this one behind me this one's a lot cheaper to use it's around 60 American a day and I'm hoping to go and learn some new flip tricks I want to learn came dogs some new Wildcat variations get comfortable with my switch riding basically build up the principles and some of a skill set that I'm missing in my snowboarding as well as putting in some foundation work on my front side and Cal spin so I can bring them to the bigger airbags and get used to it it's a fun bag very small jump around half a second of air time rides equivalent to like a 15t jump but if you have good pop and you have good power it's going to give you plenty of air time to get sevens all the way up to Nines around if you really want to so it's perfect size for learning new flips and new spin variations [Music] [Applause] [Music] we're around a hour and a half inch of a session and the day is going super well I've already learned so many tricks first I learned a different way to do wildcats and involve throwing my shoulder downward but giving me more spot with less going up making it so I'm doing like less of a back flip and more over tail and doing it that way went and allowed me to go and get uh front Rodeo 5 with a trick I've never done before so right away two new tricks and then I tackled one of my biggest fears and that's a tame dog I haven't tried a tame dog since I was a kid and hurt my butt many of times trying it off of icy patches so here to go do it off a jump and have it go well got it within free tries was a super void of confidence I'd want to do it a lot more before bring it to an actual Park jump but if there's a good powder hit I'm going to Ascend it then I went and learned how to go and add a Shifty to my cab under flip the first one sort of stopped my rotation so I went and popped it hard over a second one and I think that's going to look really sick on a bigger jump in the winter so I'm really excited to try that out and the next thing I tried to do was front Court free front Court free is like a trick I naturally do off big jumps with my front free but I was trying to see if I could force it and make it more like a flip uh didn't really work I'm not too sure how that trick works but it did teach me that if I go and throw it like that I can go and do cab under flip 5 but maybe I want to try my cab under flip 7 with trick I've never tried on jump before and it worked super well I did it on two different axises both felt really good and then after that I went and took my first fall because I'm working on changing my take off for my rodeos my rodeos well backside rodeos I take off very heel heavy and sort of looks like heel hooky and doesn't give me much pop up the jump so I've been trying to go and get it to more of a tow Edge so I can leave more flat face and it assaulted in my first legit fall on the airbag where I fell flat on my back and it didn't hurt at all so that was a good void of confidence if you're ever in trouble on these airbags you can just roll out L on your back and you'll be completely okay I'm looking forward to round two let's do it [Music] n [Music] wrapping up day three I'm really happy with how it went in 2 and 1 half hours I'm going to get 32 hits and it cost me 55 USD to ride back smaller airbag not only did I learn a bunch of cool flip tricks that I always wanted to try but I was way too scared to to do them on actual snow I didn't Master them but I went and put the work in so I feel comfortable trying them on after sell this winter what I'm really excited for and I also got to go and try some super different stuff for my cab spins to limited success but it did give me a bunch of reference footage I'll be able to go and use that to point out what works and what I need to go and change for my next day trying it that combined with getting more comfortable of spinning front side off the fake snow and on the switch in friends made it one of the most fun most successful days I've had snowboarding and I'm just so happy and it really shows me the value of the airbag to be able to go and try a bunch of stuff that's so drastically different than what you normally do in a safe space it really was wild to me how unscared I was doing these tricks to be fair a t dog off a jump I was really scared I almost bailed out when I was trying to do it that was almost too scary for me but after I got about initial hurdle I'm actually just focusing on the technical aspect and I was very calm it's really a good learning environment like these changes I did to my cab takeoff I manag to go and make such drastic changes that I would never make on snow because it would be too risky it had limited success but it's really going to be a great building block to that I can go and isolate what works and what needs to be changed and I'm going to do that through breaking out of videos comparing them with the pros and then taking the aspects that work and then throwing away the aspects that didn't work quite so well so I'm just so stoked on how today went it really showed me the benefit of the airbag and really has me stoked up and ready to shred tomorrow holy all of this was only $16 yeah probably the best $35 I've ever spent in my life that was Ridiculousness I don't even know how many pieces of sushi pretty much two pieces of sushi every single one of those plates that was up",

This is because full camber goes and helps you grip the snow, gives you the most power. Uh when I first moved to Whistler and I was trying to ask my coach, ask people what to buy. We're like, all the companies make really great boards. Just make sure you're getting full camber just because it's the best shape for the jumps. And if you're trying to go and push yourself as a freestyle rider and you want to get the most out of your board, full camber is really the way to go. So that's the first requirement that I needed to try this board in the first place. But I also tried the Team what's like the less pro variant of the Team Pro. And the big difference between the two and is actually the biggest selling point for the Team Pro is how it feels. The Team feels a lot like a Burton Custom where you can really feel that wooden core. It feels snappy. It feels tangy. and you can feel the power. The Pro is even more stiff, but it feels not like it. So, even though it gives you all the same amount of pop, it gives you all the same amount of tang, it gives it to you in a more adjustable way. I like comparing it to like sort of how plastic flexes, uh, compared to how wood flexes, where wood's really hard and it snaps back really aggressively. Plastic sort of comes up, molds a little bit, and drops a little bit slower. So, it's not quite as snappy, quite as responsive, but it makes up for that with consistency and precision. And this is something I've only experienced on the Team Pro in a way that I actually found really beneficial. Uh it feels a lot like a pro riders uh custom board that the company's making for them, but you're getting it just from the factory store.",

The keys to success are a good takeoff, a little bit of continued rotation with that upper body, and then pulling through with that head. So, then you can go and see that landing and use counter rotation to finish it if needed. So when I'm visualizing a backside 360, I'm first going to go and visualize that setup card. I like using a little bit of body motions when I'm doing this. So I'll go and practice with my body heel side, toe side, wind up, snap, rotate, rotate, rotate. Then I'll go and close my eyes and try to visualize those muscle movements, those feelings with the trick. So now I'm going to go and think about it. So like heel side, toe side, pop, look, carry. And this is really powerful training because not only are we training how we think the trick should look, we're also training how we think the trick should feel. And let me tell you, this works really well. I'll give you an example. I was learning cab dub 9ines on airbag in Japan. And I've never tried a cab dub 9. It's not something I'm really comfortable with. I'm not much of a flipper. But when I went and actually tried this trick, I was blown away. It felt exactly like I was picturing it, exactly like I was envisualizing it. And all the worries I had about the trick didn't turn out to be true. And I was able to throw it.

It's because as you come off a jump, your legs will naturally want to sync up with your upper body. And because he's trying to rotate and hit this angle in the other way, he can't really pop up and try to use a spin that creates momentum. So, what does he do instead? He preemptively sets his upper body in the position it wants to be in. So then the legs can come and meet it. Let's look for this one. His shoulder here is a little bit closed. Chest is honestly a little bit open, but hip squared. And look at this front knee is sort of closed off. So he's popping up. And this is a small enough angle that he's able to go and shift.

      "fullText": "So this ollie is pretty interesting because it's off a very like steep point. So it's not much of a surface to go and generate pop off of. So in order to go and get max power, he's doing something interesting. He's first preemptively setting all of his weight onto his front foot. See how he's completely leaned over there. And normally for an ollie, you think you want to like shift everything back, but here he's just going and kicking his hips back, but while keeping his upper body in the same neutral position. This is because this little transition here uh is so short. You don't actually have enough time to do do a full range of motion. So, he's going keeping his upper body in the position it needs to be for the landing and that needs to be for like the start of a takeoff and then relying on the hips and putting pressure off that tail. And I really want to note power on your oies comes from maximizing your surface area, maximizing that time your board's making contact with the lip. So just by going and pushing his board into his lip, it's already naturally putting himself a whole board length in the air. And that's before getting that little bit of pop. And now watch how his tail pops through the lip of a takeoff and then springs up. So you're not trying to spring up before the takeoff or off the takeoff. You're trying to push through that takeoff and rely on the snap to pull you up. And as he's doing this, he's keeping his upper body over. And because he wants to do this a little bit of a shifty, what does he do? He does a preemptive motion of opening his chest towards the jump. And that's why he's completely 90 here. So that way he comes up, does his little shifty, and because his upper body was set in that neutral position, already set for the landing, he naturally comes into that landing just perfectly. When you see people landing tail heavy like this, especially prolevel riders like Tru Smith, it's not because their weight set over their tail, uh, it's because their weight set centered and they're just tilting their hips towards that tail. And that's why he's able to go and hit that tail and then snap it down. So whenever you see like a red Gerard hitting with that tail first, it's not because they're going and landing tail heavy. They're just going and shifting their hips so that tail goes and lands first. Uh what's way better, if you land tail heavy consistently, you're going to snap your boards. This hit here is really interesting because look at how bad this takeoff is. It's sort of indebted, groomed, and he's trying to travel very straight. If he travels too far to the left, he won't have enough uh speed to go and do the line he's trying to do and hit that sharpened feature.",

And then when he's getting this pop out here, what does he do? He goes and make sure that this uh this part of his board's lifting up so it doesn't clip the rail and this part of the board's pushing down, making maximum contact. And that's why he's getting this such good pop because he blunted. He loaded a lot of pressure onto this edge. And as he goes and snaps off the end, that's giving him good air time. Just by not letting your legs go and sogg get absorbed, you're going to get so much power. And now this is the last one and honestly the one I'm least qualified to talk about, so we'll keep it a little shorter. But here, he's preemptly setting his weight onto that front foot.

      "fullText": "When I'm doing a rail like this, I don't have the expectation of making it to the end every time, but I'm making sure my upper body is coming forward, hips going back, keeping my center of balance over top of my snowboard. So, even if I do slip out left side or right side, I can go with that momentum. The reason why it's so important to maintain bend in the legs and bend in the upper body is because it gives you the ability to move your legs independently to your torso and that's going to give you all the micro control. So here I'm maintaining a strong bent position my legs popping up and maintaining basically the same exact position throughout the feature and that lets me go and extend out of it comfortably at the end. So again at any point here because I'm in a balanced strong position I could go and jump off my back foot to the right or to the left. And that way if I feel that I'm slipping out I have the ability to go and dismount the rail and I'm not locked in. Because the biggest misconception I see people have on rails is thinking it's a balancing task. Really, rails, balancing doesn't matter at all. If you get a good enough takeoff and you hit the rail properly, you're locked in from the start. It's when we start trying to reposition, pull our upper body one way or the other that we start compromising ourselves. And that can lead to some serious slip outs. So, whenever we're hitting rails, the goal is to take off in a position that's almost identical to the position we want to be on the rail.",

the front side free is actually dead on and exactly what you should be doing you're just making some slight mistakes on the fundamental principles that are throwing you off first one is the transition to your tow edge here right now you're coming in a little bit too wishy-washy on that edge so here and getting on that toe Edge you're sliding across and then sliding to your heel Edge you're also sliding out a bit this is not giving you a clean Edge transfer that's going to let you actually lock in that edge and engage the power if we go and look at the slow-mo view of my setup carve here you'll see that I'm trying to hold a consistent line all the way through and this is because it's going to help me load up onto that heel Edge and stay closed off to the jump if you go in and try to come in with these wishy-washy lines it's going to make it so you have a lot of erratic sideways energy that's going to be really hard to control and get a powerful platform to turn off because right here at the point where you should be the most powerful and getting to set up your board isn't tractioned in and that's going to throw off your balance a little bit so you do really good considering that but to fix this and this is something that you're going to really want to fix all you need to do is start your approach a little bit different right now you're coming in all the way from the right doing a big turn here big turn here and it's adding a lot of extra complexity but you could completely remove by just coming into a jump on this side here if you come in all the way on the left side that way you can just hold this Edge pressure and then transition all the way through what will give you a lot easier line than trying to go and Traverse all the way across the slope and a cleaner line is going to give you a lot more power and give you a lot more control what's crucial for getting a grab other than that your heel pressure and your windup position is actually really good a small change that you can make here that will really help is just wait to go and try load up that spin into your locked into that heel Edge your trying to go and lock into your spin as you're transitioning to your heel Edge right here with the upper body and that's leaving you a little bit disconnected boarded out of whack it's just not completely stacked and solid where when I'm coming in I go my forward- facing position keeping my board pointed towards the corner so I have room to turn out and make that nice little round shaped carve and then as I go and shift onto that heel Edge load it up that's when I hit neutral and only once it's locked in do I finally finish doing the windup cut so you could actually wind up a little bit more here focus on being a little bit more closed off because this brings us into your main issue and that is you're snapping too soon off a takeoff see how your upper body at this stage is already in a maximum extension if we compare that to me being completely popped off the Jump you can see that I'm pausing with my upper body rotated 45° angle down hill this is because you want to not over rotate your upper body in order to get back spin around because the more you snap up your upper body the more your legs are going to need to play catchup making it take more time to bring everything connected slowing down when you could possibly grab it's also limiting the amount of power you're getting off the lip because you're going and snapping your spin early and holding this position you're actually only using this little bit of range motion through your hips to generate the spin front freeze don't take a lot of spin because you can go and lead of your upper body finish of counter rotation but right now you could be riding up the jump the whole way so imagine this position and imagine holding that position through this whole part of a jump and then trying to leave a takeoff in it that's basically what you're doing because you're holding that position as soon as you pause in this position you lose power snowboarding Works forever power only translates as your tail leaves off the end so if you stop snapping up your upper body before your tail leaves off the end you haven't snapped off your upper body so you can do a lot smaller of emotion a lot slower of emotion as long as you keep that energy going until your tail snaps off the end and if you go and do that it's going to give you a lot more rotation combine that with a better Edge pressure will give you a lot more pop off the Jump so getting that cleaner rotation less effort with a cleaner pop that puts you up in the air will make it so your board naturally comes up to your hands a lot easier but brings us into the rotation part of the spin I actually really like this final leaving arm position your head position your rotation position it all looks really good your only problem is that you're going and getting into it a little bit too soon but if we compare our takeoffs here we can see that it's pretty similar I have my weight a little bit set more set over my tow Edge this is so I can leave off a little more flat-based uh where you're leaving a little bit more backseat heavy but it's very comparable I think so I wouldn't worry about changing this uh the amount of your snapping if your upper body is really good and your head positioning is really good uh let's Zoom it in a bit more from what I can see it does look like your eyes are locking the knuckle and you're holding it through the most duration of the jump your problem and weakness here comes right here you go and lose that spot and start looking downhill and that's why you're washing to your heel Edge because you're not holding your spot looking back uphill when you get a smoo rotation get more pop it's not going to be as big of a deal but still you're going to want to keep that spot back hill if we play my clip here you can see that I go and look forward a little bit oh I have to unlink it here uh we're going play this and just watch my head positioning watch on Landing you can see that I'm landing looking back downhill but that's only because I completely stopped my rotational energy through the spin and I'm grabbing melon grab it's really hard to do the blind Landing but even then I'm trying to keep my spot more stacked downwards instead of facing downhill so my recommendation is focus on GIS pop focus on the timing of the arms and focus on holding that blind Landing a little bit longer and it should be way easier once you go and make these slight changes so it's looking really good make these changes let me know how it goes because I think once you go and lace these steps it's going to make the front for you feel so easy so controllable and you're going to be able to lace that grab let me know if you need any more feedback because I'm here to help",

So, as soon as you feel your hands come slide off the end of the takeoff, take your arm and pull it around the body straight back to this position where it's slightly leading the spin. Let's go through that one more time because this is really where the magic is made. So, you come in, extend your legs into that downward dog. Rotate your hands facing back uphill, shoulders squared, back straight, head looking down towards the landing. As soon as you feel your hands come off a takeoff, take your back arm and pull it around. This is going to go and make it so your axis of rotation gets pulled back down to center and is what's going to let you get your feet back under you. If you don't pull with your back arm, you're not going to continue that rotation and you're not going correct your axis. That's why this trick is really flexible, but you need to make sure that you're holding this strong camera facing position and then pulling with your arm. From there, it's just like a normal 360. You should be able to fully see the landing and just keep pulling up that arm and that's going to rebalance you, taking you into the landing. So, recap, do your setup carve, getting your toe edge, not too soon. And as you go and reach for the ground, go and make it so your fingers are pointing back towards the camera.",

This is because the wax they come with isn't very good and it's not going to really protect the base. So, taking that extra time to wax your board even before the first day is going to really increase the longevity. For edges though, if you want to go and get on your board and instantly hit a front side board slide on a sticky rail, you could consider grinding them down. Personally, I've been riding for a long time and I haven't ground down my edges for 8 years and it hasn't been a problem.

Think about it as doing a straight air. We're hitting like a side hit. We're trying to go and use our body to put us up, not across. Because on a front side 180, you really can just do this all of counter rotation if your upper body is in the right position. So, let's look at Torstein here. Coming in heel edge, closing off, not holding it too long, just being really patient and getting into it, getting maximum extension. An important thing I'll note here is Torstein's extending as much as you'd ever want to. And look at how serious the angle of his board is. This is pushing the pop. So, this is the goal, but not where you want to start because that makes the margin for error much, much smaller. But as you pop, you want to make sure that you're going and lifting your chest up and try to have it rotate around 90°. This is the sweet point because it makes it so you can utilize counter rotation as soon as you bring your legs up, even when you're bringing them up. So that's what Torstein's doing here. Upper body 90, bringing the legs right up to his chest and activating counter rotation. From this position, he's now on the arc of the jump because he got a good takeoff, his weight set over his toes, and he's dispersed most of his rotational energy by having it mostly sent up in the first place, and then using counter rotation, what will diminish his maximum rotation velocity.",

If I'm in my like normal boardside position and I go and try to pop into the back board, it's going to really straighten me. So, the solution for this is adding more bend to her legs.

      "fullText": "in this video we're going to dive in and improve your straight airs so it's awesome you're taking your energy to big jumps testing out your straight airs pushing them but there's a few mistakes that you're making but our making these is a lot more gnarly than we need to be so we're going to go and Tackle those so hopefully when you hit these big jumps you can go and make them feel small and not need to worry about it you can just pull up cruise them with the boys and not need to fear for your life on a given occasion because this looks like a serious fear for Life moment so I'm going to give you some tips that should hopefully remove this from ever happening again so that's the goal first we're going to go and take a look at one of my Straight airs and we're going to go and just point out some of the key points that I'm trying to hit here and then we'll go and see how we can go and apply those to your riding so the first thing I want to note is this is a very exaggerated straight A this is me trying to get maximum pop and it won't be necessary for the bigger jumps but the reason why I'm going and still using this one as an example is because it has very good textbook for textbook form that you want to hit you just don't want to do it as exaggerated as this so the first thing that we want to notice is look at how squared over top of my snowboard I am I don't have my arms going and having one over here one over here we're both in line with each other my weight's completely set over the balls of my feet and that's why I can get away with this Bend you don't ever want to have your weight shifted forward this is called breaking of the waist but if you go and let your bum come out and you go and hinge forward in ratio with that that keep your weight set over the center of your snowboard and that's only possible with that straight spine so this is the bent down position that you can use to get maximum power that said this is my maximum maximum power position and look at how little Bend I still have in my legs and upper body I'm almost more bending the upper body than the legs and that's because you don't want too much Bend in your legs having less B of the legs makes it easier to handle the GES of a jump and makes it so it's a smaller motion to extend making timing much easier and that's the next thing I want to point out is the timing so you can see that my chest is opening the opening here slightly but it's happening in a straight up ratio with a pop and the most important thing here is leaving off of the end of the tail that goes and sets you up so you can go and get a nice clean up flat and down AR ideally not needing to go and make any adjustments in the air so when you're going and actually doing your pop you can let your upper body open a little bit but we can see here that I'm still staying very straight legs are straight stacked relatively over the body and the arms are coming out but they're in ratio in correlation with each other so even though this one's over here a bit this one's over here so it's keeping my center of balance stacked over here with that out of the way let's go and check out your fraters and see what we can go and apply to them to make them more consistent so first we have this one here and we can already see that your arms are in a good stack position seems like a good spot for weight on the balls your feet but you're going and not hitting this extended motion and this is happening because you're having a little bit too much Bend and too much hinge in your torso see how when you come through the spoon of a jump here you go and get somewhat compressed this is called ging out and this is happening because you're holding too much Bend in your legs through the spoon of a jump so you want to be a little bit taller in the legs here because that's actually going to make it so when you come through the spoon it's less powerful in the legs and it'll be easier to hold a strong body because all What's Happening Here is you're coming in with a little bit too much Bend you're getting crushed through a GeForce of a jump because it looks like a kicky jump and that's setting you back seat making it so you're going and leaving with your chest a little bit open and leaving a little bit heel Edge and that's where this unbalance out of control feeling comes from I want to go and just Freeze Frame right here this would be the perfect amount of Bend in your body you don't need more Bend than that that should be your maximum Bend point and you get really comfortable a jump and then you can start adding a little bit more but a big jump that you're still learning you want to make sure to have your legs straighter rather than more bent so we have a few more straight airs here we're going to go go and look at first this one the almost dying one this is happening for uh honestly let me go check this out to see why this is happening because that is not normal uh okay so my best guess why this is happening is right here see how you're starting in the squared off position and then as you come off a takeoff you're going and putting more weight onto your tow Edge and then as you pop see how your Upp body is opening up as you pop that combined with this little bit of tow Edge basically setting you up for a Hardway uh front one because you're going popping off a tow Edge while opening your upper body so you just snapped a hard way front side 180 by accident there so that's why this happened uh we can go and fix that and that can never happen again by going and keeping more tall and more strong the body so we can see that same problem happening here but to a less extent and we can tell it's happening because your tow Edge is digging up snow off the takeoff this means you're too heavy on the toes making you use that edge pressure so what you want to be doing here is removing a lot of this opening of the chest and lessening the amount of Bend you have in your legs we're going to go and just do a little comparison to end this off and that will go and give you you the final little bits of changes you want to be making that should be good enough link it Zoom it okay that was a smooth setup nice so comparing the two actually I want to go and just show right here at the start of a takeoff uh see how tall I am coming through the spoon of the jump that's because it's for the gForce so that's the first thing I want you to add come into a feature taller you should be at a very tall position here with just a very slight Bend in your legs just enough to put your weight on the balls of your feet then I want you to hold that taller position until you get to around well just through of a spoon of a jump hold that taller position until you get through of a spoon of a jump then you can go and do your Crouch down and I want you to really lessen this Crouch down instead of this position I want you to be in this position but with your weight set over the balls of your feet just this level of Bend of the legs then hold that and hold your stacked position of your upper body much longer don't let yourself open up when you're getting used to these big jumps you don't want to try to pop and actually push off a jump you want to do something called a coast and that's where you go and keep your legs a little bit straighter and just let yourself go off a body and doing that will make it so you can go and keep your focus on keeping your chest more square off a jump what's really going to help you because that's the big thing that's throwing you off here is your ging out and then you're having your upper body rotate a little bit what's making it so you want to rotate in the air so for this position here we want you to be almost fully extended the legs upper body completely stacked and you want to be tall in the Torso make those changes make those adjustments and it will make it a lot easier uh it's not going to be big powerful pops off these big jumps right away just so you know you need to build that up on smaller jumps get comfortable with it and then get comfortable with the big jumps before trying it so go focus on keeping straighten the legs coasting rather than trying to pop and that's going to make it way easier to go and get control of these jumps and you can still do a little bit of a pop a little bit of a motion just to feel more control of the jump I'm not telling you to not do that at all still do that a little bit just don't try to go and actually generate that power through your legs your legs are only there to go and guide your board make sure it maintains tail pressure and set you up for a straight tall position you're not really trying to get more power of your legs than that because the jump has plenty of power and using proper form making sure that you're more tall on the body will give you way more height than any amount of springing power your legs can give you so try this out let me know how it goes and let me know when you're ready for the next steps",

How snowboarding actually works for generating power is you want to channel your momentum through your feet, through your knees, through the hips, core, chest, head. It's through linking this up and down range of motion that you end up getting so much power and so much control. It also increases the amount of time you have between these movements. If I just try to go from this position to this position all at once, it's a fast motion that doesn't have very much longevity. Where if I go and slow it down all the way through here, then I'm getting maximum power. And as I'm doing this, I'm adding a little bit of bend through my legs and then extension at the end.

So, in order to do this, he can't go and hold his usual toe edge pressure position. If we go and zoom in here really quick. So, normally when you're going and jumping and everything, you want to keep yourself in a stacked position over your toe edge so you can get that slight ball all your feet pressure as you pop off. But in this case, he can't do that because if he went in on a toe edge, he would have drifted too much. So, in order to counter this, he's going to his heel edge. But if you go and pop off your heel edge, your legs are going to kick out, you're going to get unbalanced, and you're going to land heel heavy. So, what does he do? And this is genius. He goes and counters it by putting his upper body all the way over. This is making it so his center of balance is still over top of the balls of his feet even though he's going and taking off of his heel edge. And because of this, uh, he's able to go and pop this jump. And look at his center of balance. As soon as his legs come up, instead of the legs going kicking out, his center of balance is boom, perfectly over the balls of your feet. And that's really the secret to generating power, generating control, is making sure that you're taking off with your weight set over your balls of your feet. You're in the air in that position. And that will make it so you land in that position. So even though he gets a little bit swirly here, I'd say he's just getting swirly here because look at how much he's trying to open his upper body towards the chest because he's the reason why he's opening his upper body towards the takeoff like this is because he needs to go and rotate his board slightly. He's trying to land straight downhill, but he's on a bit of an angle. So preemptive motion again setting his upper body forward. And that's going to make it so his board naturally rotates. But we can see here his board's actually rotated too much. is now angled this way because he opened his upper body a little bit too much. And that's where this rebalance is coming from. See how he's rebalancing and shifting it back downhill. And look at this center of balance the whole time he's doing it.",

There's a cliff, so I'm a little nervous. Okay. So, more bend, even smaller motion. Taking that foot, stepping it down. See how I'm keeping my upper body hinged forward. I can go and use the full spectrum. This is balanced. Nice pop back. Basically, you want enough bend that you can go and pop in this motion, but not too much.

That's because if he rotated his upper body more with this tall position, it would shift his weight all the way over to his heel edge on a snowboard and it' add that contrast in the upper body and legs would make the board warp. And if your board's warping in front side board slide, weight shifting towards the heels, we know what happens there. And then the other issue is getting on the rail properly. So, like these two front boards, not too bad, but they're basically falling off for the same reasons, just at different points. On the left here, as he's coming in, even though he's doing a really fantastic job of maintaining tail pressure, we can see the legs are extending a little bit. And to compensate for this, he's rounding in the spine. We never want our spine rounding because it's really hard to add twisting to the spine. If you try to twist it to rotate it from this position, it's going to put one shoulder down, one shoulder up. So, we always want that spine in a straight position.",

      "fullText": "in this video I'm going to teach you 10 of the most common mistakes I see across the [Music] mountain when alling you need to go and load up L onto your back foot and cough off it but you can't only load L onto your back foot if you low L on the back foot and just leave off it it's going to make you land tail heavy this is why we want to combine it with a pump motion like you would be doing over a roller trying to go and pump through so when you're doing an ollie it's like this shift your weight slightly to your front foot not enough that you start going into a node press but just enough that you're having your weight slightly centered over that front foot from there we want to go and shift the weight over to our back foot and pop off a tail and as you're extending off your tail that's when you rock your upper body forward back into the landing so it really looks just like a complete rocked ping in coming off the tail and rocking forward if you're missing your body pulling back to neutral you're going to land tail heavy every time the most common mistake I see when jumping is people going and using too much Bend in their legs and business making it so they can't go and get their legs fully up when they're exploding a super bend down position is going make it really hard to generate power for your legs and go and push off a lip what you want to be doing is keep your body a lot straighter a lot taller using your athletic stance this stance is what goes and gives you a ability to get up get power with pushing off the Jump this position is too much energy to go and lift out of that's why we want this little slight Bend legs but gives us a more useful range of motion you have to get way more strength out of your snowboard five is the only slight Bend so when you're jumping the slow make sure that you're not going and fully squatting down lifp yourself up and make sure that you're leaving out of that athletic stand that's going to give you so much more control and power on every paw when snowboarding you want a little bit of edge pressure to help you grip the snow but if you TR to go and pop off into a jump the to much Edge pressure it's going to angle you so if I get onto my heels and start to pop off it's going to kick my legs out toes and hard to pop off it's going to make me drip and get a radit that's why we want to go and to move oursel to a more neutral position as we go and pop so you start with that little bit of that pressure and as you go and get more extended that's when you D and straighten it off making it to your leaving flat base by keeping your base flat as you dry power fr it more weight will be distributed through your snowboard evenly give you more vertical up and down power this is really true for spins if you try to spin off a big tow Edge it's going to go and buck you but if you let yourself go and get flat face as you take off it's going to be putting your momentum straight back into the air so whenever you're spitting make sure that you're coming and flattening up to a more flat based axis well popping if I'll give you more efficient energy straight up the most common mistake I see on turning is heelside Chatter and Toes side chatter this happens because people are trying to go and Traverse to their Edge before they go and Shi for momentum if you go and try turn this way but immediately turn this way and then immediately turn this way you're not going to have enough traction to hold your Edge how Turning Works is a lot like a bar the more tracing you have the deeper you can hold the tur and the more P can start loading into it so on a day like today where the snow quality is trash you don't have much traction it's really important to face out these turns so instead of going straight toes to gels I'm going to go toes flat face load up then heels tow Edge then I load weight then I lessen that weight flat Bas Edge load up flat face Edge load up and by going and slowing down your turn radius more power but more controlled big thing holding people back is moving their body too connected so if for trying to do it turn for trying to turn off your whole body at once and when you turn off your whole body at once you actually lose all the fundamental principles you can use on a snowboard in order to build traction that's why we want to actually lead with our upper body fall off our legs and use our body sort of sort of like a slinky one part flowing into the other and this is what's going to give us more control more power more movement we're going and trying to keep everything independent but working together building momentum building fluidity through every single turn and this is how how you can go and start getting loose fast and explosive movements this is especially true for spinning if you try to do the trick rotating everything at once it's going to be very hard to get everything around you're not going to be building momentum what you want to be doing is letting your upper body build momentum and then popping up as you're hitting that maximum point so for back one I'm not just trying to rotate Everything at Once instead I'm leading with the offer body falling off the legs and then Landing that's going to be a disconnect and control needed on every turn and every spin one of the most fun things you can do on a snowboard is put a grab but a big problem I see is people wreaking from a grab too soon this goes in P SP range of motion short makeing it so they don't get much buff and we're going and not getting control over the jump what you want to be doing is getting your full extension then grabbing and then controlling so it's a fre step process but PP but grab but tweak so if we're here we're popping B grabbing if you try to rush a grab on something like a spin it's going to be even more detrimental so I here if I try to grab too soon it's going to put me through the jump make it so I don't get that fluid motion so again we want to do that reset process but pop the grab then but tweak and by going and splitting up our tricks into this will'll get so much more control and so much more power on every jump when riding I see people doing a lot too much so if for trying to do a tail press we're trying to really push everything to that tail but really you're trying to keep yourself relatively stacked and over a point if you're popping you're not trying to fully extend trying to fully piss off the lift instead you're trying to use a tle random motion giv you control and tension the poor by actively staying in your control motion you're able to go and get up get so much more control when snowboarding than you ever could if you're going and extending if I'm trying to do things like a butter and I'm going popping up too straight pulling is going to throw me off so that's why I want to stay in my comfortable into motion po up and this is going to be what lets me get all nice and fun with my snowboard just trying to use that effective range of motion that works on every feature and every trick one of the biggest mistakes in all of snowboarding is going and breaking at the waist and trying to go and disconnect it and hinge that the hips the reason why this is problematic is it makes you really top heavy and more top heavy you are the harder it is to go and put weight into your snowboard that's why we don't want you to be bending over like we're catching your toes instead you want to be strong and the poor put us in a strong position where we can go load an edge and hold this position Grill so here I'm in a position with a little bit of Bend but I can go and flatrate and pull in and that's giving me the control to go and pop and really FR my snowboard but as soon as I go and Scar kinging forward I'm not going to have that control and I'm range motive to go really going it that's why you're pretty sketchy so when you're riding make sure that if you go and squat down you're not getting lower by going and bending forward and instead you're bringing your legs down and your upper body down in correlation and it's B correlation but could you fluent power that's driven directly over your board give you the control you need to tread the mountain every Spin and snowboarding relies on something called the setup car to be the base of the trick the biggest issue I see in snowboarding there people going and getting on their Edge too soon and this is making it so I leave the rotation if I get on my key Edge and hold it it's going to make me spin off the Jump and that's going to make it so I pop off without much control if I just get on my towet too soon I'm going to drift and not get back control though the most important thing when doing your set of cars is patience the longer you hold a w up position the more it's going to make you cut across and make your chest open and this is how you get that gnarly drip and lack of control so we want to go into layer setup carve to a spoon of a jump toes toes toes spoon heels and that's lets us fully pop up here you want to go fly through the spoon pop up as late as possible the more you delay your setup car but easier it is so here coming up get on my heels and then popping up and this lets me fully utilize my range of motion making it so I can get more power with less crease bin getting cleaner jumps every time and that is 10 colon mistakes you want to avoid at all costs let me know in the comments below if you're making any of these mistakes and if you're ready to go and fix them and improve your riding thank you so much for watching we'll see you next time",

So for a backside 360, I use rotation for the first 180, counter rotation for the last 180. This will go and space out your rotations, making them a lot easier to do. The key for this is to make sure that your shoulders are holding a neutral position. If you have your arms low when you try to do this, it's going to make it so your shoulders want to dip down. I try you to use counter rotation dip down. I'm going to land one foot heavy. So keep your shoulders squared in your body. You don't have to be like full on fug fighter mode, but we want to keep them here relaxed, not coming too high or too low. A big problem people have on trampolining is they jump and use their arms to lift.

And this is because popping off the lip and getting that extension will naturally go and throw your legs up to you as you get that moment of weightlessness. Uh here my legs are pretty straight because I was a little bit surprised at how tall I was going. But watch this. The upper body is angled and as the legs get pulled up, it now angles the legs to come back in line with the upper body. And this is the key to riding any side hits or hips that go and make you land angled is preemptively setting the angle of your upper body off the lip. So that way as your legs come up, your whole body is naturally aligned. And then what else am I doing here? I'm going and bringing up my legs to me a little bit. Not super much. I'm not trying to get styly here. This is survival mode. But I'm bringing my legs up to me. And as I bring up my legs to me, I'm going and letting my upper body hinge forward. Keeping that center of balance set on the same point. The more you go and bring your legs up, the more your hips need to go out and the more your upper body needs to go forward in order to compensate for this, in order to keep that same center of balance. And the reason why we want this little bit of bend in our legs in the air here is so when we come to the landing, we can go and meet it. So see how my legs are in a straight extended position while I'm keeping my upper body hinged forward. This is keeping my center of balance over the same point. And by meeting the landing, it lets you go and absorb the impact. And that's going to make it easier to go and uh handle all the G's. And the last thing that's really important for landing all of these is making sure that as you crunch down, your center of balance is being in the same spot. So here you can see that my butt's coming out, my chest is coming down, but I'm having them go out and come down in correlation to one another, keeping that center of balance at the same point. For something like a powder landing like this, you'd have no idea if there's bumps or anything like that. If you let your weight come a little bit too much to your head or too much to your hips, it's going to make you go and start slipping out. And that's why it's really important to maintain that stack position even if you're tweaking it for what you're trying to do. Here I'm doing a cliff drop to a pillow to a not too ideal landing. And let's go and break down the different techniques I'm using in order to go and fail on this one. I slip out on my heels and don't land it.",

And a lot of the problems people are going to have when trying to learn backside spins is the fact that you're blind for the first 180. So you're going to feel in a rush to go and get the spin around and try to get it to your toes. But the more power you put in and the more you start to rush, the more disconnection it's going to make in your upper and lower body. So real power and real control on backside spin comes from taking off in a neutral position, keeping separation of the upper and lower body. So then you can channel that minimum motion into a fluent spin. But there's more that goes into it. And this is where body position becomes so incredibly crucial. When we're doing something like a backside 360, we do something called the same position formula. And that's having the same position on the heel side, toe side, wind up, and snap. But I know what you're thinking. Why am I seeing like different bending of the legs? like this isn't the same position. And that's because the same position is referring to this the angle in the upper body. So watch this clip really closely.

      "fullText": "In this video, I'm going to teach you how you can train your front side board slides off the mountain. But first, let's break down what makes this trick work. There is three fundamental body motions that you need to unlock before taking your front side board slide to snow. The first is being able to do your full motion while maintaining your center of balance over the balls of your feet. This goes and lets you stay balanced on the rail and makes it so you're way less susceptible to go and fall backwards or forwards. Next is maintaining a little bit of hinge in the hips and a little bit of bend in the legs. This lets you go and fully utilize the rotation in your torso, your hips, allowing you to get your board into that 90° position. Lastly, you need to do all these movements while keeping your head as stationary as possible. If you have your head going up, down, moving all over, it's going to throw off your whole center of balance. So, you want to go and do this whole motion while keeping your eyes and head locked in the most similar position possible. That said, this trick is ridiculously challenging to learn. It took me many years. is I was trying dub back 10s, landing double wildats and making finals at the national level before I could do a proper front side board slide. So, let me tell you, I understand the struggles of this trick, and I understand how hard it can be. And these summer training routines, this kind of way of thinking about it is really what helped me make the breakthrough and made it so I could start lacing this trick. So, a big issue people have is two front. First, they go and try to pop onto the rail. This fully extends them, making them tall and moves their center balance from their balls of their feet over to their heels. Next, they try to do way too big of a position of counter rotation. This collapses the side, compromises the body, and makes it so you're just you're in a sketchy spot.",

So none of these clips that I'm showing I'm doing absolute perfect form. Here you can see that my board's coming off early and that's because I overextended my legs a little bit. But I maintained the key principles to success. The slight hinge, the slight shift to the back foot, and then because it's a backside 360, it doesn't matter as much if I then go and shift a little bit to my front foot, keep it a little bit more centered because it's a more flexible trick. So that's what I want you to focus on and that's what I want you to find is whenever you're riding, whenever you're doing motions, first locate the upper body position, the bend the legs you need to do that specific trick. From there, you want to go and work your wind up, your takeoff, your snap, all while maintaining the same center of balances because we're not trying to go and generate through our legs like here, trying to pop up and extend and force it around. Instead, I have my hip slightly shifted back. So, I'm riding off my tail. I'm lifting my body, but not so much I'm losing my hinge. And even though I'm slightly crunched to the front foot, what's completely okay on a back three, it's able to go and come around because I'm hitting these principles good enough. So, find that body position that lets you go and do these tricks in good enough. And if you need more help finding them, that's what these specific tutorials will be for for like backside 360s, backside 720s, because every trick has little tweaks and little tips to make it easier. But the general consensus is you need this stock body position, and you never ever want to expand yourself out of it. So, do you want to ollie? Do you want to jump? You can ollie and you can jump in the right situation, but you should never go and compromise your body to do",

do to get these feeling better uh I went and read fuis basically you're having an issue where you went and started doing fs and your axis rotation is starting to get messed up and now you're having trouble spinning on your flat rotation so you're trying to figure out how you can go and separate it for your back FES back frees and back sevens because back sevens are a trick that's going to really push your fundamentals and push your skills so if you have any flaw with your takeoff your drift it's going to be emphasized to the maximum on the back seven so even if it works we need to make sure that it's a back seven that's performed the right way that's all going to stem from the 360 takeoff and the 540 is a trick that really goes and messes all this stuff up because I like to call backside 540s a cheat trick there's a lot of ways you can cheat to make it and get it around uh where you can't cheat for a back seven and a back free it just will mess you up so first we have a back free here in Dome and this is going to be what's highlighting most of your issues here uh so your biggest issue on this backside 360 is your approach notice how you're going and getting onto your toe Edge much too soon you're getting onto your tow Edge all the way over here I want you to get on your tow Edge over here at a spoon of the jump so this means I you need to go and delay your heelside carve coming in and switching to your toes as you go through the transition and that's going to give you a much straighter line because when you get into your tow Edge this early what's going to happen is you're going to be on your Edge and it's going to keep digging and digging in digging in digging in causing you to curve and even more than just a last minute curve it's going to cause your momentum to be shifted to the side and sideways momentum is going to cause drifting and it's going to make it so it's hard to control in the air the next thing that we need to go and re adjust here is uh your takeoff so there's two things going wrong if your take off here I'm going to make this big and we're just going to zoom in uh first of all your shoulder is dropping so see all your back hands going up and your right arms going down this on a bigger scale and with more power is going to cause you to start corking so we need this posture to be more flat parallel you don't want your line to be angled uh like this Let Me Wait for those lines okay uh you don't want your shoulders to be dipping down on an angle instead you want everything to be flat with the angle of the jump I'll go and Show an example of my backside 360 and we'll get more into that later your next problem is your spot see how your eyes are still spotting forward even though your board has left off a takeoff and when you're rotated 90 your head should be around already looking towards that Landing so you're going and dropping your shoulder and not really leading the rotation with your upper body and you're blocking yourself off a bit and that's why you're going and getting caught up so you can see you're going and popping and then you're trying to look around but you're not spotting until you're around 180 we can spot a lot sooner than this and that will allow us to get a lot more control and the reason why you're going and need to go and move this around is not necessarily because of the drift that's not affecting your power too much drift more affects control and axis what's going and Mak it so you need to use counter rotation here is the fact that your head and upper body is delayed right here causing you to need to go and tighten up and try whip it around so those are the two things you need to change for this change that setup carve get a smoother approach transition to the heels through a spoon of a jump and then keep your upper body on a flatter plane of axis not letting your shoulders dip up and down we're going exit out that one and move on to your airbag attempt and once we get through all these attempts we'll go and uh check out my 360s and 720s and stuff and see what we can do to move on to the next step so here you can see that your mistakes are super emphasized because the jump so much bigger so your setup card was actually better time for this jump you can see that you're waiting to get to your toe Edge Into the Blue lines here that's exactly what you want to be doing on every jump so it's not about time uh on that tow Edge you it's really about like the shape of jump so a smaller jump you still need to be getting onto your tow edge around when the jump starts going up if you're getting on your tow Edge when you're still downhill or flat it's going to make it so it's really hard to to hold it so your setup carve timing here isn't an issue but on a jump this big it is easier if say you're getting on your tow Edge for the first time here so what I do is I'd hold heels just a little bit longer and that's going make it more delayed and make it easier to control I can understand why that'd be a little scary because you don't want to fly off the side so uh that's not too big of a deal and it's fine for this jump and we can see that your takeoff is quite a lot straighter here that takeoff angle on the board that's fine we wanted to get get it straighter but that's like an acceptable amount so that isn't your main issue here instead what's causing your drift is this Lean Forward Motion you leaning like this is causing your weight to be set over to the side it's going to cause your momentum to kick you over so what we need to do here is the same thing need to straighten up and stay strong because when you take off leaned over like this uh it's going to go and just have that access rotation match so that's why you're corking is because you're matching the angle that your body was on the takeoff and we can see that this would work for a five but this is what I call a cheat Cork and that's where you're going and getting the cork through breaking up the waist instead of leaving off your tail and that's a cork that isn't very powerful and flexible and it's going to go and really make it hard to control the spin so for this back side 360 you need to focus on keeping this upper body straight up not angled forward because as soon as you let yourself start angling forward on a jump this big it's going to go and magnify these mistakes causing you to topple over and get this cork axis that just won't work so we're going to exit out of that and move on to the 540 what we'll be seeing here is uh the same mistakes but it's just going to be shown in like different ways so this one actually a lot straighter and a lot better A takeoff on this back five you're throwing here and your takeoff is smother uh and straighter than your backside 360 what's really good to see we obviously want that on the backside 360 as well but nice to see that you do have it here on the five so nice on the five getting around caught up oh H it actually looks like that might have been the 360 either way this is a much better takeoff your problem here is you're crumpling over your front foot so see how your body is bent over this foot and this legs more straight that means you're taking off too nose heavy and nose heavy is going to also cause you to get off AIS because you're not going with the angle of the jump instead you're pushing down what's going to cause you to spin on this like flat tail up path so uh what you need to do here is be more patient patient and let yourself leave off the tail of your snowboard your weight is just shifted onto your front foot and then why is your arm getting caught here okay so the reason why your arm's getting caught is because you're on this weird axis from leaving nose heavy we can see it right here uh actually a couple more frames right here see how your nose is dipped down and your Tails going upwards that's not really what you want you want your tail to be down more and or just flat just you don't want your tail lifting because we can see that you're all crunched up onto your main foot here with fists extended and that's going to put you on a weird axis that's going to be hard to leave the rotation because imagine trying to lead your backside spin with your uh left leg straight and crunching up on your right leg it's going to make it hard and it's going to make your pivot point over your right foot not easy so we want to shift that Pivot Point from a front foot over to to the back foot and that's going to make things a lot more approachable uh yeah so again arms getting caught and everything here it does look like you were going for a five here just by like the spot and getting leaded but it's hard to tell I wouldn't worry about the air too much that's just everything comes from a takeoff you know uh so the takeoff is what we want to fix and here is your seven so I'm going to zoom in and we're going to go and watch it so take off yeah takeoff angled a little bit early uh crunched over to the front foot same mistake causing it to get on this cork uh this axis of rotation doesn't work for sevens and the main reason for that is the spots impossible when you're this sideways at 270 it's impossible to go spot at the knuckle and that means you're going to look up over around your shoulder to try to get a spin around so that's my prediction on what we're going to see here and there it is right there see how you had to go let go of a grab and move your spot to around the shoulder we always want to be spotting under the shoulder because it's going to keep our core tight and it's going to keep a pivot so this is again just an issue off a takeoff causing you to be on an axis that you're not going to be able to hold a spot and you're not going to be able to control so uh we're going to go over to some of my 360s here because you're having mistakes and you're like struggling with a five and free seven but it's really all the same mistake and it's just coming from not having the takeoff fully dialed in so we're going to go break down some of my 360s some of my forms just looking at the takeoff breaking down why we're doing it this way what's making it work and then I'm going to give you a little bit of a recap and what steps to take take and yeah we'll go from there so one thing I really want you to notice on my 360s is I'm going and uh keep sorry I'm keeping my shoulders and everything nice and flat so see how when I'm taking off my body is tall in a straight line and most importantly my shoulders are rotating in a relatively flat line uh where here when you're taking off for your spins you're usually crunching up this leg making this leg more bent up and this leg more extended extended uh that's going to cause your aess of rotation to be over this foot where we really want every access of rotation to be set over our back foot because that's where we're going and matching the angle of the jump and that's where we're going to be leaving off is that back foot tail so you want your weight to be set over back foot and the other thing I want you to notice here is look at my shoulders whenever I do a backside free six I'm actually popping both my shoulders up and rotating fluid and smooth so we're going to go and play this one back one more time watch my shoulders I'm not going and throwing down into my grab instead I'm lifting my whole chest up and that's going and go and make it so I'm tall extended I'm getting good pop up and then watch my head position right at 90 I'm in casual composition and that's going to set me up to go look under my arm so you can see right at 90 I'm already spotting the knuckle and I'm able to spot that the whole way where when you're taking off you're going and keeping your head just a little bit more here so your head position is sort of like here when you're rotated 90 you need to just be leading that with your head a little bit more I think why this is happening is because you're trying to not throw down so it's making you delay your head movement so what you need to work on is working on throwing and lifting because if you're lifting vver no problem leeding your head you can go and leave rotation as much as you want and it's not going to go and cause you to break up a waste and not going to increase with drifting so we need to get this throw from downward motion to an upward motion so now we're going to go and look at the fives and see what we want to be doing here because you're currently the most happy if your backside 540 but that's only because the backside 540 is very forgiving of the current mistakes you're making because we really need to get these 360s 540s every thing we need has this super tech takeoff that needs to we dialed in so we're going go and watch the next one that's a little more corked just so I can show you that like the cork does not come from breaking at the waste so here this one I'd specify as corked and the reason why it's corked isn't because I'm going and leaning forward you can see that my upper body is completely straight and this is actually how we want to be cork or spins your your cork shouldn't be coming from going and pivoting down because that's going to put you on a weird axis that's hard to control instead your cork should come from angling your rotation over your tail so instead of breaking it's about just going and taking your whole body and leaning it into your tail and that's how you get the cork formation so here my shoulder tall and extended is dropping down towards my tail more than the angle of the jump and that's what's going to go and let me get the cork if you go and match the angle of the jump you're going to go and get a slight dip that will line you up for the landing and then the more angle you add the more cork it's going to be so again just emphasizing that we need that straight body takeoff and we can still cork with it and in fact it will give you more control and the last one we're going to go over here is a seven so it's actually really good here on trampoline I don't know if you have access to a trampoline but look at this takeoff so this one I'm slightly pivoted over my front foot not as big of a deal because it's on but just look at how tall my upper body is and how much my back arm is leading the rotation chest spinning on a flat parallel body straight this is where power and consistency comes from for a backside Spin and then the last thing I want to show here is look at the spot see how my rotation is flat so I spot at 270 and then I can drop my head down and keep that spot going uh it's a little hard to tell in this video we'll see you a bit more in the snowboarding but when you're doing a perfect backside seven perfect back three perfect back five your eyes are going to lock on the knuckle at the soonest Point possible and you're going to track it for the full rotation the longer you can keep your eyes on the knuckle the more air awareness and control you're going to have just because you can see what's going on if you have to go and break your vision even for a millisecond in a jump it's going to disconnect your body and that's going to make it so you can't keep going and changing your access and getting more power so this is a pretty big jump we go and break down one on a smaller jump again first of all the straight takeoff really important you can't be doing these spins without a straight takeoff because it's going to make you land really heel heavy and the next thing is you can see I'm able to go and let my shoulders throw a little bit downwards towards my tail but that's only because my upper body and legs are completely straight right keeping it a flat axis and that's really the emphasis and the thing we're trying to go and break down this video is we need you to get that back straighter so I'm just going to make myself big screen quick oh I guess I'll show the spot quick uh so here you can see my head is locked on the knuckle I go and speed it up a little bit but I'm actually not going and losing sight of the landing for this instead I'm just shifting my head into a position that's going to let me pull and lead the spin more what's exactly what we want to be doing if we're going into moving our head and rotating it faster it should be to speed up the spin not readjust our access so end notes I think you need to just go back work on the 360s all your mistakes are happening just off of a takeoff so it's not the time to be moving on to 540s 720s uh it's just not beneficial you can go and do the tricks and you can go and them but we're not trying to to go and do that because it's not going to make you a better snowb in the long run if you're struggling with a good 360 that means you're going to struggle with every single backside spin so even if you can find a way to it and make it work for a five you can go make it to your feet on a seven you're never going to be able to progress past 720 so what I recommend for you is take a step back go back to the backside 360 and figure out how to do the spin with lifting your chest and leading the body with getting a straight takeoff that is the Baseline requirements for doing these tricks and moving on you need to go and have that straight line that's laying going and pop up and have your upper body lifting and keeping everything tall and stacked once you can do that on your 360s you'll be able to do that on your fives you'll be able to do that on your sevens when I went and joined my team in Whistler I went and did what's called with Jolo and that's where Joe takes you and he just tears you down and makes it so you can't do anything but 360s until you master them I went and I was doing 900s I was even trying backside dub T but my takeoff and my form was bad I was breaking up the waist I had major inconsistencies and I wasn't able to hold clean grads because of it but by spending two months just focusing only on backside 360s getting this form and getting a powerful backside takeoff it made it so my back fives back sevens just everything came so easily so it's fine to go and push yourself especially on the airbags a safe environment and try these tricks but you're not going to be able to really learn these tricks and master them until you get this backside 360 dialed in so my advice for you go figure out your setup carve start delaying it and figure out how to get that straight edge line the key for that is going to be going and slowing your Edge approach and transitioning through the spoon of the jump what's right when the jump starts going uphill that's makes it so much easier and makes it so you have to hold it less for Less period of time and then the next one is going to be instead of trying to snap down where crouching throwing your chest like down into a spin try think about lifting lifting your chest because then when you're doing your like backside five backside seven you're still lifting your chest but it's happening subconsciously so on the backside 360 you know how you can like pop up your ol you're lifting your whole body I want you to be doing that with a backside 360 lifting your whole body up into a spin and that's going to give you so much more control and help you lead the rotation of your upper body because right now you're drift drifting a bit dropping your shoulder and keeping your head here getting you stuck so you need to consistently lift it and match the aess of the jump and that's going to make it so much easier uh the next thing you can do I'll just demonstrate this quick is you can practice of the opening of a hips backside 720s require a lot more power and a lot more intense of a takeoff so it's not something for power on snowboard you're not just trying to go and drive more power by going and like shorten your motion trying and speed it up instead you're trying to extend your range of motion to snap so let me just go put this down here for a sec so uh the training I do for this is dropping my hips and opening them like this and this gives your chest a good platform to go and wind up the important thing here is to make sure your knee doesn't curve in your knees need to stay in that stacked strong position V go and let you open up your hips keep a stronger form and give you more range of Rion to snap will give you more power so work on that form work on opening up those hips work on staying tall and leaving off and that's going to make these tricks so much easier but awesome to see you're pushing it stoked to be able to go and help you along this path but really my honest advice is just go back to 360s get these steps dialed in try to get your 360 locked in with that straight takeoff and that tall body and it's going to make these spin so much easier it's going to make you feel so much better in a snowboard uh let me know if you need more help or have any more questions

So, it's not just a size difference, it's a technique difference. And look at how much more angle I have on my board right here. You want a little bit of angle of your board towards that right corner because it's going to increase your turn radius making it so it's harder to drift. If you go straight from heel edge to toe edge, you're going to be able to come off completely straight. So having this little bit of angle towards the corner of the jump really lets you smooth it out. But the less angle you have, the slower you can do the transition and the less geforce you have. So, he has this angle right here and he'll be able to just gradually gradually change it all the way up, maintain a straight line without having nearly as much Cyrus momentum because look at how fast I traverse with a spoon. I'm all the way on the left and boom, all the way to the right side with that big of a duration. Same duration of time. Look at how little he's traversing across the slope. If you're traversing across the slope, well, switching edges like this, it's going to be impossible not to be leaned forward.",

So, we wanted to use this aggressive aggressive heel side approach, getting our hips open, chest open, and everything angled towards the corner of the jump. This is true for front side as well, but not as important because you're not doing as big of a windup motion. Then, you want to transition your edge through the spoon. And as you do it, you need this little section of flat basess with your board angled to the corner. This increases your turn radius, making the whole process way easier.

Instead, it's just set on the same angle as my upper body. And this is the key for these spins. It's making sure that your upper body is on the angle that you can snap your arms in a straight line through it. We're trying to remove as many up and down bends in our waist as we can. And to do that, we need to have a taller posture. So, because I have that taller posture, I can throw it, keep it, and then I'm maintaining that axis uh that I went and set off the lip. Our main focus here is going to be on the back seven because the back seven goes and really highlights these mistakes to the maximum. Back sevens are the first backside spin that you really need to go and have absolutely perfect proper form in order to do it correct. So what's happening on your backside seven right now? You're coming in snapping the spin throwing downwards. This is making it so you're corking too much. And because you're corking too much, you need to look up and around your shoulder doing something called a double spot. Double spots and this axis rotation are really hard to control because first, you're losing sight of the landing right here.",

First things first, get in your stack position, lock your eyes down here, and we're going to utilize our counter rotation. Close off our upper body and keep your finger pointed at the middle of a Then I want you to jump and rotate and keep your eyes on your finger. See how I'm now looking back up towards my back foot. And we can do this other way here as well. Eyes pointing out of the finger coming up. Well, I got a little disorientated there. Let's do it regular middle of a Eyes locked in. Try close off. And then utilize that counter rotation. See how my arms pulling across? Once you're getting comfortable with this, let's go and start doing it with a little bit of bounce. So, I'm basically just trying to bounce and do my rotations while keeping my spots at this one point. We can go and switch arms for the switch one. And we're just trying to get really comfortable of spinning with our head in that position, not getting thrown over. If you're going and trying to do this and you're getting bounced back and forth all over the trampoline, it's a good indication that you're relying on too much breaking the hips, too much leaning in order to hold your head position. So, I want you to practice holding your eyes here locked on and rotating 180. Once you get that, let's do the front side variant. So, I'm going to put point my finger right here in front of my foot. Rotate a 180, then another 180. Keeping my eyes on it, we'll go and do it. Switch now. Eyes here. 180. 180. It seems a little bit simple, but I'm telling you, most people on trampoline don't do this. A lot. What happens on trampoline is when people are spotting, say a backside 180, if we're going to spot, eyes on camera, eyes on camera. See how that doesn't let me use disconnecting my core, upper body to get the rotation, it's going to make it sound really blind. I actually can hardly even do like a 540 spotting like this because I'm not able to see where I'm at in the air. So, even though this is such a simple training drill, it is absolutely crucial for learning any of the bigger tricks. So, let's go and use the final one, the backside 360 to train this. We're not going to do a full backside 360, but just eyes here spotting, rotating through. And once you can go and hold your hand here, rotate through in the strong position, that's going to be so powerful. It's going to really help you translate to the future bigger tricks that we're going to cover in this series. So go master this principle, master your counter rotation, and after you get those, it's time to learn how to",

If you can do those two things, you're going to be able to get it around pretty consistently. So let's talk about how you can do that. First, it is a backside spin, so we need to hit it with a backside setup carve. Heels to toes. And it's really important to get on your toe edge around the spoon of a jump. Too soon on your toes here, you're going to start turning off the lip, and that's going to make it really hard to get that up and down power that will help you get your legs over your head. So, being patient getting onto that toe edge is going to really help. From there, we want to go and get oursel into a nice position. This position here, even though it doesn't look too proper, it's actually exactly what I'm going for. And that's a neutral upper body, shoulder squared. And this is because this position right here is pretty much identical to the position I want coming off the lip of the jump. So, we're preemptively setting our upper body into that position. Hand placement is going to be the next thing that we need to really think about. So, I want to hold a strong position, straight back, and just let yourself come down. So, see how close my hands are to the ground? Instead of trying to reach my hands rest of the way by bending down, instead I go and push and extend my legs. And see how that kicks my legs up and that goes and kicks my arms down. As I do that, I want to take my upper body and shift it and rotate it this way, trying to place my hands both facing back uphill.",

Relying on the mechanics of the jump and the mechanics of the grab to go and bring it around, making it really controlled and nice. Now, we're going to really talk about one of the main goals I have for the winter and what I'm trying to fix, and that is these cab takeoffs right here. Uh, we actually might as well just use the cab 10. That's coming up in a little bit just because bigger trick. Uh, going go and showcase the mistakes even more. This one's pretty cool. Front free double grab. Just coming up a little short. The snow was so slow today. Uh, whenever you're riding and it's like really dry, cold snow, it's incredibly slow and incredibly inconsistent. Combine that with some wishy-washy takeoffs and like look at this right here. Uh, this is not good for controlling speed. Look at how much snow I'm kicking up at this point in the transition right here. So, this body posture is really bad. We're kicking up snow. We're really leaned over. Upper body has a fantastic hinge, but the legs are almost fully extended. This is a weak position. And watch what it does for my legs. My legs have to traverse so much more than my upper body. And this is making it so I'm getting this little drifting motion. And if your edge is drifting, it's not grifting. And that's making it so I don't have ability to fully open my hips here. And I'm opening my chest independently. What happens if you open your chest without having your full hips open is it's going to make it so your board actually wants to start turning this way and your weight gets set more over the front foot. So, let's go just go and talk about how I'm planning on fixing this quick. The fix is really easy, really simple, but in practice, it takes a little bit to figure out. And basically, it's going and being in a way more squatted position here over in this direction. So that way, I can take a more consistent setup carve line the whole way through of the transition will leave me up in a better platform. Also, by sinking it slightly towards the back leg, it'll be easier for me to get my hips open. This will increase the range of motion, make it so my back foot's a better pivot point, give me a way better platform to generate snap off of. Because as I generate snap here, because I'm getting closed off, because I'm preemptively rotating, I can't really see what I'm doing. And that's going to make it so I'm going to be timid putting power in. I'm also putting power in too soon, and I don't have that upper and lower body disconnection to keep the board straight, making it so the speed's going to be really inconsistent. Uh, other than that though, the trick itself is pretty good. This is a grab I'm working on. It's a pretty funky one, and that's one of the reasons why we'll see a little bit of funk in my form because it only works on a particular axis of rotation. Uh, but here, just go a little bit slow, didn't throw hard enough, choose your poison, and it resulted in this really nasty looking scuff. Uh, revert. And now look at, we can really see the weakness of my front side windup. coming in heel edge instantly closing off. Look at how much head's kicking up. Look at how leaning off the jump. Make it so as I snap off, I'm really drifting. I'm really not centered over my board. It gets a little nice cork axis. But when the snow is this slow, it's just impacting speed too much. So, let's talk about how I'm going to get that better quick. So, I'm going to add a lot more bend to the legs. I'm going to go and squat down more. And this will make it so I'm able to keep a more mellow line with a more similar position. This will also make it so I don't need to do a squat down motion here. And instead I can just do a close off. And in theory, I'll be able to get onto my heel edge just by shifting the hips back a little bit. This will let me transition from toe edge to heel edge with very minimal movement. And because of that, it should be a lot nicer of a platform to close my upper body. There's also one more thing I'm going to try to do, and that is taking my hips and trying to shift them backwards. I just sort of discovered this this summer, but there's a principle in snowboarding called uh pedalling the board where you're trying to get like in this instance, you'd be trying to get your front foot down, back foot up, where here you can see my board's completely up. We really want the board like twisted because it's going to make it so it holds a straighter line without as much leaning necessary. This is pretty much impossible to just do with your feet. what I was have been trying to do.",

Basically lets us get the same benefits of an ollie but without all that extra body dynamics of trying to get that motion because if you start front foot, shift to the back foot, try to get that ollie a little too complex. So I'm preemptively shifting my hips to the back foot, pulling my upper body forward, hands forward. So then when I go and pop up, my weight gets slightly shifted towards that front foot. And here you can see it's still completely in line, completely straight, and I'm just slowly shifting those weight to the front foot. And then at this position right here, because I maintain tail pressure, my board's naturally over top of the feature. And because I'm fine hanging at slightly angled, alls I need to do is utilize a little bit of counter rotation. The key to this is stability. We want the head in one position, the chest in one position, and we don't really want it lifting up or going down. Instead, we want a comfortable enough position that we can hold this and then just counter rotate through it, staying as still as possible. Because if we go and start adding a bunch of dynamics, it's going to make it a lot harder to control. One of the biggest mistakes you'll see on front side board slides is this, and that's just staying too tall and extended. The reason why this is problematic is look at how much he's struggling to get that board slide completely 90 and he doesn't really have much balance. When you're completely vertical like this, there's two major downsides. First of all, you can't really pull your hips back and pull your upper body forward to rebalance. So, it's all based on leaning. And when you're leaning from a tall position, even a little bit of angle will put a lot of your weight away from your snowboard, making it way more likely that you'll slip out one way or the other. So, you don't have flexibility.",

For that, we want to cut out as many variables as possible. So, what do we need for a backside board slide? Really, we don't really need to drift onto the feature because just by going and keeping our board relatively close to the feature, maintaining tail contact, we can go and counter rotate and our foot will be naturally over the rail. We want to go and do our board side set either over our front foot or back foot because it gives us more room to go and kick out one foot. Way easier to get into the 90.",

      "fullText": "today we're continuing the spiritual journey of trying to understand what the hell happened at knuckle hu 2025 but this time we're prepared we have glasses so we'll be able to see these tricks clearer and more analytical than ever before starting with this mindboggling belly slide uh the motion for this trick isn't too complex itself you just try and kick out your legs get to your belly but the thing that makes it so hard is how much speed he's taking in to be able to still air off a knuckle with that much drag so he comes in gets his body as low as to the ground kicks out his legs you do not want to clip your knees there and I think he actually sort of over rotates it a bit see how was like upper body slapped in and that took away a little bit of his power uh from that motion so you're not continuing rotation because you know you slapped it stopped it so you're able to just tuck your legs back under So in theory if you can go and get onto your stomach and slide you'll be able to do that trick uh but you have to go super fast here o cat one butter oh into a back five I think that's cab one back five I'm not sure if he's regular footed or goofy but the reason why that was so stey is he did something called a counter rotated back five where he lets his upper body rotate more then catches up with his legs so starting with his cab one here getting his rotation so he's completely set over his back foot this makes it so as he goes and has his board snap off the end of the jump uh you can see he's not fully extending his legs uh that keeps him on a little bit of a tilted access that will let him go and get to his feet in a better way way bfes are one of the rare tricks that you s of want to cheat with a preemptive cork it's easier than trying to go and throw the cork you can do them proper but other than that he's letting his upper body rotate preemptively so he can go and catch up with his legs and the big difference of him doing that versus how a lot of people do it is he's catching up with his legs right away so he's catching up basically immediately he's throwing into that snap position so he's rotating a ho 180 with that counter rotation the reason why that's cool is when you go and accelerate your spin with counter rotation it actually slows down your spin so it gives that fun motion of spinning slow spinning fast and then spinning spinning slow again uh if you have a good back five back three try a Shifty in there it's really fun and it actually makes the landing really easy because you're coming in with a lot less rotational momentum Dusty here what's he got oh the Miller flip ring back this is one of my favorite tricks he's got it's so stey so cool and basically he's doing the same thing as he did before millerit 360 Max extension but he's keeping his upper body counter rotated and he's using that arm to stop his rotation and you can see he's going and continuing to counter rotate his lower body away from his upper body this is giving him more ability to stop that rotation but allowing him to pull it back uh very Tech trick very like high risk you miss that hand you miss the counter rotation it's going to be hard to get to your feet oh here comes zeev in the massiv board ever um pretty sure his set up the wrong way so this is coming in switch 360 butter 360 so not the most wild trick we saw tonight but what's so cool about this is the board he does it on we'll see it in a slowmo replay but this thing's so flexy and it gives oh we won't see it in a replay but that board's so flexy it gives so much spring it really changes how you can do these tricks because you can really load into it and you need to adjust for it but just works perfectly for Zev style Liam here oh and just completely missed it uh let's go and try see why leam missed it here it's very rare to see this guy fall or mess up so when it happens it's probably for a good reason so comes in stey back one love to see it uh getting back one's on a downhill pitch like that way harder than it looks so he's coming in pour His butter rolling the butter and it messes up right here I think he just lands a little bit Edge heavy yeah see how he's on his edge here this is just my can't so he's not on his tail he's not able to go and get that pop up so as he goes and tries to pop his board's catching and gripping where he'd want to have his board rotated a complete 180 here and then have his board more smooth on the surface would have given him the cleaner pop I'd be interested to see what tricky was doing out of that because I know Liam has like some crazy butter doubles I'm sure he does like but he didn't get much height like that's the big difference and that's why this knuckle hu is so gnarly because there's nothing to give you air it's all generated from yourself so the fact that Liam could have done a single or a double there and it just would have depended on the pop out of his board is absolutely ridiculous obviously speed plays a major factor as well but generating that much pop and that much Bend you need so much commitment to load into it uh here's heldor coming in man I don't know if anyone was watching snowboarding back in 2010 but hellar would do the sickest edits in like the red DC jacket the hair coming out I thought it was so cool I tried to grow my hair out like that for a while but never could rock it like he could oh and just went for the Miller flip it looks like he probably went for the pullback and just missed that hand so he had to continue the rotation and that's why these guys are so good they miss something and they still have ways to get out of it safe so he pops up and it could have been a 360 yeah this was going to be a 360 the whole way really cool he does that uh method grab and pulls it around and it sort of like stalls out his rotation making him hold that like inverted method grab uh really cool trick helor has some of the best like inverted methods and it I haven't played around with it because it's really scary to fully extend your body upside down but it seems like a good way to get some interesting rotation speeds and here we are uh nose butter backside 14 absolutely ridiculous uh and V wasn't done like the most stylish way possible because of a start art of a spin see how he goes and needs to let his whole body rotate a 720 no a whole 8 850 is before going and getting the grab bats frowned upon in snowboarding in snowboarding you're try and hit that grab as soon as possible and rock it as long as possible uh but this I actually consider to be a pretty cool trick uh because he's sort of doing like a rodeo type of thing is how I'm seeing it like Rodeo into his dub back 10 axis so let's go and see the rotation here coming off a nose rotating and Ben he sort of starts flipping yeah so straight into his how he finishes like a dub back 10 but just starting with that extra rotation I don't know I sort of I'm sort of down with it would be cool if he grabbed at 270 but still very impressive trick and this guy some of the sick is Instagram clips and that was so Tech not the most impressive I'm sure to like watch there live in person because he's not catching much air but there's so much going on oh they're not replaying that well we're replaying that that is I can't believe we didn't Replay that that's such a sick trick so what happens here he's coming in tow Edge rotating forward so the same like uh backside Miller flip this is sort of like how you try to do a backside Miller flip when you don't know how your backside Miller flip you just reach your hands down and try to get on your nose uh misses it a bit pops up gets on that tail and that is a cool snap off a tail but that honestly could have been uh fall like I'm he probably wanted to get that full 360 around and didn't want to go on butt check so probably just didn't get quite enough pop but the fact he managed to generate a flip off of that little corner of a snowboard very impressive all right Patrick oh probably the sickest backside 360 ever let's go and see how this works because this is one of those tricks where I'm like I don't get it I do not get it uh I do not get it okay so he's going and leaning forward there's a couple reasons he's leaning forward the first is when you're doing like a backside 360 off of a flat ground a side hit or anything it's actually normal to let your upper body come down and have your hand come low uh just because it you want to keep a bit more of a flat base too much Edge pressure on it is really hard to control and it's a good way to go and preemptively get that rotation while setting your aess so this lean over motion isn't actually improper but he's also doing it because he's trying to imitate for like front side roll motion yeah so this is actually one of those like front roll front flips but he's going and tweaking it out to go and make it more flippy than it is so see how we can tell this because he's going and being completely 90 here as he's upside down in the flip if he was just doing like a straight on front flip kind of 360 straight invert his board would be facing us towards us you know like tail towards us uh but because we see it turning to 70 Dees that means he's going and doing this like a front roll 360 uh was basically the same trick as the backside flip free it's just a very Advanced version where he isn't grabbing or he isn't touching the snow and the fact that he's pulling his board like that is turning it more flippy than it normally would be so at that point normal backside Miller flip and then he pulls his legs and that's what changes the tricks so normal backside Miller flip approach and then a different grab and a different way to apply it turns it into one of the sickest tricks of the event so M damn stey maybe I can get that one I got to grind out some back Miller flips as this as well this is teaching me that like oh oh man so wild butter dub 10 whoa so that's just the same trick he did before but he threw it like a dub back 10 he had plenty of air time plenty of power uh so he was like yeah I guess I got it and that's a important thing to note like that's how I decide to do bigger tricks but seven felt easy okay I probably got a nine and Dusty the single felt easy the double will probably feel fine that was Madness he's done this trick before but that doesn't mean it's not one of the gnarliest tricks you can ever do uh so a tail blunt double tamed do so he's popping in rotating the 180 and I think the reason why he didn't give a maximum pop here is because he let his chest go down a little bit early he's not putting much pressure on that tail loading up so it's not putting him very high so he's really going and just using his board to like more smack down yeah he's more smacking it instead of loading it and popping over so when he's doing the single he's like trying to hold more of a press keep it more uh proper and over that tail but for a double he seems to rush into that flip a bit more uh that tells me that that snapping and slapping the tail right there is really important for generating that rotation so when you guys are at home trying this trick uh remember that the tail snap good for spinning faster oh my God I don't like you can't practice that trick on the airbag I'm pretty sure he just pulled up did the single and then was like yeah I can probably do a double so wild all right Zeb coming in man that was so sick let's go and Rewind that one sec just a proper five off of the side hit yeah nice back five good power should we go and take that frame by frame yeah we should take that frame by frame all right zip let's see see how he gets so much power here so keeping his upper body really nice and over top of his board you can see he's not hinging forward leaning and look at him fully utilizing that super long snowboard to generate a lift and generate pop that's putting him so high in the air because this is such a steep run and this is such a long board that's giving him so much air time and look at this snap that's a good enough snap for a dub back 10 right there and then pulls through yeah that was really impressive to generate that with no speed makes it really hard to balance and on that downhill pitch honestly probably ze's most have like impressive technical snowboarding of the night like that was a really good backside takeoff off of a really hard takeoff situation I'm not I'm not bullshitting that was a dope backside 540 uh this trick I hope they give us a Le replay here because how his board Flex is is so sick so 360 butter and hits snowboard down and the only reason he can lean back this much is because of how long this snowboard is and that's what makes that so fun to watch it's a trick that could only be done with that snowboard in that way just making it super cool not enough to like win event like this where people are going and doing such like technical tricks but as a viewer I love to see it Liam coming in knuckle Hook is so brutal if you start not Landing stuff oh it's really hard to go and get it you need to really have that consistency uh Liam's just trying the hardest tricks you could ever try him a knuckle like Miller Double Miller flip off of a knuckle that flat like people have done it in the back country but off of a park knuckle that would have been an nvd I'm pretty sure all right and this was requested uh this is going to be the hardest trick to break down of the Knight because it's using a lot of mov sets a lot of motions a lot of technicality that I'm not familiar with uh but you know hellor experence Rider I'm sure he's went and practiced this before and I'm sure he's skied before that probably really helps because this form this technique this Arc let's just go and appreciate the stack position keeping his weight centered right over those heels like in order to go and keep your body weight of his position we have to get really Tech here we can see that he's putting his upper body on a 55 degree angle this is letting his hips come out at a 45° angle what this does in correlation with the arm positioning and the elbows being aligned with a belly button is it sets your weight to a 90% accuracy onto your heel Edge the reason why this is so important is because if you go down to a 92% grain you're going to go and start clipping your toes a little bit and that's why this trick is so Technical and the skill barrier is so vast because you need to go and have enough heel Edge pressure that you're not catching your toes but not so much that you're going too slow to make it such a sick trick and look at how fluffy the snow know is vat's making this super gnarly Edge catching I just wish he would have went a little bit faster but he really made up for it so probably the best trick of the night uh he was robbed not getting gold for that and there we go and analyze helor uh trick realistically side slip pretty easy I'm pretty sure most people could do it uh and I'm pretty sure like I don't know if heldor is watching this but if he's down I'll race him like we'll do it for YouTube I'll put the life on the line we'll go to like the straddle and Whistler and let's see who's the fastest Sid slipper it's really that's probably the most gnarly race you could do in snowboarding uh oh and there it is the highlight of the night the thing that broke the internet the triple tame dog uh we'll go and break this down but technically it's not going to be more complex than the double but there's a few really interesting things that happen that make it fun to talk about and also just like imagine why don't you win the knuckle hook so much you go and do a triple front flip so the gnarly part here is he almost Clips his nose and tail uh if he would have went en clipped his nose and tail he would have been absolutely boned let's go and see like could he ever do four I don't think you could do four so let's see how early on he sets this first flip because that's going to be the interesting part so he flips really early uh like 10et after the takeoff of a jump so that means he's going and traveling like 80 feet for his triple tame dog he's going completely out forward he's not wearing about generating upward momentum what pretty interesting uh so he finishes the first complete flip by the end of the knuckle so he could have went and landed on the knuckle if he went a little slower and did like a double tame dog after uh he was not going for that because he was tucking his hands and the legs so he was just spinning with maximum power if you see the arms committed like this very no doing anything but tucking and praying then he flips and then as he comes over the knuckle he goes and Tucks into the other flip yeah probably over 100 feet he traveled down there really impressive focused on going forward instead of up and it worked uh I can't say I've ever tried to be in that Vortex it's an extremely blind trick extremely scary looking one and it's a miracle he landed it and I'm grateful he did because it was sick so here spot it yeah blind spots blind spots oh and being able to go and commit to get fully rotated to actually land at is so wild that's my big problem of tame dogs I I have trouble going getting it fully rotated yeah oh just sucks in gets the power perfect control what an absolute Legend all right last couple borders of the night the Hat that's pretty cool uh this is basically like if you know how to do a back flip off a cliff or something this is the equivalent uh it's narly because you're risking catching your heel Edge but this is going to be the most familiar backflip motion people can do the reason why people can't backflip that way is because it's really hard to get yourself in position to actually pop off uh so that's a wild trick because you just you don't ever see someone in position to do a straight back flip like you would off of a cliff pretty cool all right nice arms he always has such good arms Ste man I forgot that happened to him oh my God that was so dirty I don't even know like the thoughts that'd be going in your head at that point that's so ridiculous oh my god let's sorry it's just this is a great clip so goes pops off maximum pop maximum extension so committed and he just gets a little bit too leaned back uh I think this is a case of going for a grab a little bit too soon so he goes and comes in open chest I wonder why he wants his chest open here closes it off a bit but we can see that his like legs are rotating a little bit and his chest is open actually think that's an issue and about something that caused his slam a little bit here and then let's go and see when he starts actually grabbing his spin or grabbing his trick and he kicks out straight into that grab generally when you're grabbing you want to go and finish your pop and then grab to get back control but I could imagine it be hard to lift the board with one leg but I think you just opened the hips a little bit rushed that grab and that went it so it was too open and had a hard time getting into that Landing okay let's go and see this Landing to see how he survive Qui he's just a ninja that's how he survived that's a I'm dead 10 out of 10 times there that's a dead situation he was full extended one leg out I can't believe he got his board down oh my God that was so cool and I think the last dude to drop is I think this video is getting really long so we're trying to speed it up uh just going and trying to clean up the double but just missed the grab didn't get it through awesome reflexes to get it around that goes to show how much air control these guys have uh when that's why it's so beneficial to learn your tricks on airbag because when you're learning them on snow normally it's too dangerous to not fully commit to your tricks like if you pull out of a dub back 10 you have to be really confident about pulling out the right move uh but when you have airbag you just spend so much time getting so many other positions and it gives you that ability to train those reflexes and train that muscle memory to help you know how to get to your feet uh and here we got the Miller flip over the board a zeel classic at this point and this is just a front side Miller flip you got to pop it pretty high because you got to get over at board touch it and then I guess backside Miller flip but yeah just cool because of the boards there nothing too wild though and then yeah Liam here last trick uh spoilers but just doesn't get the snap doesn't get the hand drag even not his night but yeah that's knuckle hook 2025 I think the glasses really helped with that I felt pretty locked in there uh we'll go and do this again next year when more madness goes down but thanks for watching I hope you learn something new and I hope you're ready to Huck some Knuckles sometime soon",

      "fullText": "hips angled, upper body's angled, all towards the corner. Uh, just done a little bit too soon. This is a little confusing because it like sort of starts curving and it sort of looks like this is going uphill, but I should really be delaying the setup carve all the way into like this point of the jump. Uh, this is just a really early time to be getting on the tow edge. And let's see how I transition. So, flat base, two toes, and yeah, I always want to see a decent transition, but look what happens. I can't hold this position. I start crouching down. crouching down into the spin. This is an ideal. We're trying to hold a strong position because that's going to let us spin on a smooth axis. But if you go and crouch down this much, what's going to happen? You can't go and snap your spin across your body because it's going to be angled downwards. So, the only thing you can do is fully extend your body upwards. And this is making it so you're adding more dynamics to your spins. And you're never going to be able to get a lot of power through doing your spins this way because I'm needing to go and pop up and explode. My upper body isn't able to continue the rotation through out my chest. Instead, I'm relying on pushing up and pulling the shoulders. We're also making another mistake here. This hand dropping to the board instantly. So, you can see my board's hardly even off the takeoff, but I'm already reaching for that grab. And that's really what's throwing me off is that big squatted down position. And that's just something I didn't really know. Just you it's really important to not go and squat your legs too much here too. See how much bend I have in my legs here. My legs should be much straighter because if you have this much bend in your legs, you have to go and have your upper body come forward in order to compensate for it. So my legs in all of my spins for this season were too bent starting. And that's making it so as I go and throw, look at how my hands touching my board, I'm completely broken at the waist. This is going to still happen sometimes if your legs are straight, but it's going to happen pretty much every time if your legs a little bit more bent. And look at how I'm hitting that grab really early on. And then I'm needing to rely on this really exaggerated upper body pull in order to recorrect my axis rotation. So, I'm not getting a clean motion. I'm not getting powerful jump here because I'm breaking at the waist. I'm throwing down towards my snowboard preemptively trying to hit that grab. And that's why I have to go and let go of the grab and I'm landing in this sort of weird offaxis tilt because I went and set myself on that bad axis. So even though it's landing, it's basically the difference is see how I'm off kilt right here at 90. This isn't the axis you want to be on for backside 540, but it's going to happen every single time you break out the waist. Front side five.",

So, we're going to go and deep dive it, take a look at it, and see what we can learn from this legendary video. The thing I want you to keep in mind for the full duration of this video is how much bend he has in his legs, how much in his hips, and where is his upper body set. So, for here, he's coming in for this light little pump. And see how as he goes and drops his legs into a more squatted position, he's pulling his upper body forward, keeping that center of weight over the balls of his feet. This is very narrow, very precise. So, he needs to make sure that his range of motion is also very narrow and very precise. He's now shifting his weight slightly to that front foot before rocking it back and pushing through. But notice how as he pushes through the spoon, he's still keeping a little bit of bend in his legs, keeping his upper body over, still over the balls of his feet. We're going to be seeing this through the full video. Now, as he comes off the lip, instead of popping, he's actually absorbing a little bit, but the reason why he's not getting bucked is because he's keeping his weight again set over the balls of his feet. A little bit of bend in his legs, and he's pulling his upper body forward as he's going and shifting his weight back. What this is doing is letting keep tail pressure throughout the duration of the takeoff while keeping himself centered over his board. And now all he needs to do is let his hips catch up back to his upper body and his back centered. Shifts his weight all the way forward to get into that landing. Pushing down. And now he's going to shift it to center. And now he's going to pull it back into this position. This is pretty much a perfect coasting position. not letting the jump g him out by keeping his legs strong, keeping around 90 95% bend his knees and the most important thing keeping his upper body forward in correlation to hips going back in order to maintain that balance over the balls of his feet.",

That's where your toes are hanging off the end. And you'll get something called heel drag. That's where your heels hanging off the end. This makes it so as you rail the turn, your boot actually hits the snow. And it really limits how deep you can get into your turns. So, if your foot's bigger than a 10, I'd highly recommend looking into getting a wide snowboard. The downside to using a wide snowboard on more narrow feet is it's going to make it so your board's less responsive because your pressure points are going to be set further away from the edge, slowing down your turns. That's why on something like this, a wider board doesn't really matter because it's a POW board, so your turns are slow, flowy anyway. But if you're trying to have like a high performance park board, you want to make sure you're getting a board that fits the length of your feet as close as possible. And I'm sorry for anyone of solid size 12, size 13 ft. They really don't make boards wide enough for you guys. And you're always going to have a little bit of that toe and heel drag.",

So, that's going to be one of the biggest things you can go and figure out in the winter is how much do you need to let your upper body come over in order to maintain that heel edge pressure while maintaining your stack position balance point. So, let's go and feel around with that. squatting down, shifting weight to the heels, and just getting cozy with it. We can even practice holding this position a bit if you're looking for a little bit of an exercise. This video is just about teaching the principles, teaching how to find it. We'll go and make some follow along workouts later in the year. So, with that, let's go and move on to the hardest part of the stack position, and that's adding extension into it. A lot of people when they jump their snowboards, they're doing something called lifting. And that's where they try to lift their legs up to them as they jump. But in snowboarding, you actually want to go and push into the ground. Try to form your whole snowboard into a slope. And by doing this, we'll go and get the maximum use case of our muscles, the feature, and our snowboards. But what's really important when we're doing this is to never let ourselves go and extend straight positioned. Because what happens if we fully extend our legs? we moved to the flat base and we lose our stack position. So, this is the biggest problem most people have when they're actually jumping or snowboard is they'll pop into their legs or completely straight. So, what I want you to practice and get used to this idea is your popping should never fully extend your legs and fully extend your body straight. If your legs fully extend, what does your upper body need to do? It needs to come forward a little bit in order to maintain that same center of balance. So, I want you to practice just some little light jumps while trying to maintain your center of balance over that same point. If that's too easy, let's go and add some spins, keeping the center of balance over the same point.",

      "fullText": "in this video I'm going to teach you a technique you can use to make sure you never go and catch an edge how can I demonstrate an edge catch without dying anyway Edge catching is when you go like two flat base and you like clip your toes clip your heels it results in some gnarly slams you see it happen a lot and stuff like Butters where people are like buttering and they clip their Edge and you get tossed but there's techniques we use as professional snowboarders to make sure Edge catching isn't a problem to an extent but I can go jump up into front board back board swivel I'm just not remotely concerned about catching an edge at any point in any of these motions so that's what we're going to learn today how to go and unlock that control and Flow State but let you go and land sideways do Butters all with confidence and it all comes from having your balance point when snowboarding a lot of people ride Too Tall this keeps your weight set over your flat base if your flat base when you go shift into a board side it's going to go and put you at risk of catching a edge but when you get more advanced at snow boarding you start making it so every single time you're going in on your board doing a turn doesn't matter you have a slight bit of edge pressure and how buttering and side slips work is if you have your Edge pressure so here forward- facing so I'm heel Edge pressure it becomes impossible to catch an edge I could go and slam as hard as I wanted into here but as long as I maintain that little bit of edge pressure I won't catch same at front side if I'm back then I'm made to make sure that my heels are up so this is the principle we use and it's really important for safety say you're learning front side 180s you Tred to pop a front one under rotate you need to make sure you're Landing with those heels up and that heel side slide up position if you're rotating with your back to The Landing say back one under rotate you need to make sure you're Landing with your heels slightly up but how do we do this without compromising our form this is done through something called stack positioning stack positioning has two forms your toe side stack positioning you'll know you're on this when you're slightly turning towards your toe Edge and your heelside stack position this is where you're slightly turning towards your heel Edge from this point my pressure points are on even my toe Edge or heel Edge so that means I won't be at risk of catching an edge so we'll go and show example of this quick here I'm on my heel Edge so that makes it so I can completely butter around swap it without any issue if we're doing the butter the other way it makes it so we can shop it around move around without need to worry about that edge bus are very down low so where it's easier to hold that edge pressure but how do you do this for your Butters you need to be a little more tall in order to keep that power over your board we do this through squatting up and down up her body keeping everything connected watch this as my legs go down my upper body comes so as I squat down my chest comes to my knees but I don't want my upper body to come down without that or to stays too straight if you try to keep too straight of a body as you squat down it's going to make it so your weight is what set over the center of your board making it susceptible to catching an edge if you try to lean too forward it's going to make it so you don't have enough power and weight set over your board make it so you can slip out and tunder so what you need to do to make sure you never catch an edge is just get really comfortable these stack positions it has a full range of motion of 360 and that motion is trying to find that balance point and loading on getting that full range of motion so you can get fully 360 movat while maintaining this subtle Edge position and this is all done by keeping that weight set over at toe point and heel point and swapping between them fently and efficiently and this is also what helps Landing so when I'm doing something like a front one I'm shifting from that heel Edge balance point to that switch tow Edge balance point cab one other way around and this makes it so much more safer to start doing these Butters we'll get into a little clear section here so if I'm doing like a front one butter I'm going to keep my weight stacked over my board and then I'm going to keep that edge going uh we'll do a little 360 thing here if I want to keep my board turning I'm going swap edges every 90 so here I'm spinning circles I'm swapping my Edge for every Point getting very dizzy in a process uh and that's really the secret if you go and have your edge up going the direction that you're going downhill it's impossible to catch an edge catch and if you go and keep out a little bit of bending your legs by bending the Torso the body position stacked over your board it makes it so you have that Mobility to rapidly adjust your angle of your board your positioning and stay completely in control and that's what unlocks these butter tricks this flow all that good stuff so if you're struggling catching your Edge on your snowboard I highly recommend taking some time turning finding the stack positions getting that range of motion that you can really get up and loose with it will stay in control because once you can do that you'll really be able to start woo spinning like an absolute lunatic down the mountain if you enjoy videos like this one leave a comment below helps boost the channel I'll

Counter rotation is when you lead a rotation of your upper body and then pull it back across your body in order to come back into a neutral position. You can think about this as like wrapping up a towel. You wrap it up, let it go, and it whips back to the other place. So, we're going and building tension in our core, and then when we go and pop up, that tension will naturally want to decrease. And then when we go and counter it and pull the arms the other way, it's going to rotate us. Counter rotation is really useful all the way up to 270 degrees of rotation. And this is going to make it so it's way easier to learn a trick.",

So that way when you do get on the snow, you'll have the base set so you can start initiating some really fantastic movements. So, first here is my stable stack position. And you can see as I go and squat down, it's going to want to put me more and more towards my heels. And that's going to make it really hard to get low and start moving independently. Being completely stiff and center like this is really hard to move around. But as soon as I go and shift this to my back leg and twist my upper body and pull it forward, I now can get myself so much lower towards the ground while maintaining these same principles. A big thing that people get confused on this is the difference between leaning and hip shifting. So here's leaning. I have my whole body leaned over my back foot. And you can tell I'm in this position because I can easily lift this leg. But through just hip shifts, I'm coming down stacked neutral position, pulling the hips back, taking my upper body forward. And now I can still lift my front leg, but I'm not able to hold it up there balanced. I have to use my core. This is giving me the 60% of weight on back leg, 40% on front leg. And from here, as I want to increase my range of motion, increase my squat, I shift back more and more and more, letting my upper body rotate more in correlation. And this is how we go in flow through these turns. When I'm doing a jump, if I have my hip shifted back, upper body forward, when I pop up, it's going to make it so my back leg extends, front leg stays a little bit nicer, and that's going to naturally put me into this ollie that goes and comes back centered. We do this with a trick, say a backside 180, it's going to make it so I can just pop up and rotate super clean.",

And that's going to let that will be what lets you go and spot the whole duration of the spin. So, I want you to go and visualize sort of like your front side spins. You're taking off hard way. So, you're on your toes like you're going spin hardway, then you shift to your heels popping up. And that's going to make it. So basically, I want you to practice a hard way front side 360 position, but you're still doing your setup carve just like you would for a normal front side spin. That should keep you more over your board and let you get more power off that tail, letting you get more up. Because ideally, what we'd see is when you do a front side 360 office jump, it's actually going to throw you slightly off axis and get you corking just because you're lifting and matching the angle of the takeoff so much. Okay? So that's what I want you to work on for front and think about. We'll have a recording of this video, so you don't need to memorize all this right now. Uh the backside 360 is a little more complex because it's going to be like changing how you're doing it fundamentally. Yeah. Right now, as you're spinning the front backside 360, as soon as your upper body is hitting here, you're connecting your core and tightening everything. And that's making it so as you continue rotation, your front knee's coming in like this. And that's why you're getting this rotation in this position here. Yeah, you can look at it. Uh, and that's why when you rotate, you're coming in and everything's all connected. So, the issue here is because you're rotating your whole rotation completely connected, you're not going to have any micro control or adjustment. So, if you snap your rotation too hard off the takeoff, you're going to over rotate. If you snap it too soft, you're going to under rotate. So, the solution for this is what we call disconnection, where we disconnect our lower body and upper body slightly. So instead of going and snapping here, connecting everything tight and pulling it in and trying to rotate together, instead I'm snapping here and then my upper body keeps going and only once my upper body's here, then my tail takes off, then I connect it. So then everything's stacked here and that lets me take my upper body's energy and channel it and pulling through. So the difference is as soon as you're hitting neutral with your upper body, you're now ro you're rotating with your hips, rotating with your knee, and continuing it. And that's what's causing the pre- spin. But what you want to be doing is having a slight separation of the upper and lower body. So as you rotate past this point, your upper body keeps rotating, but your legs are still staying straight, popping off the jump.",

So, what I'll do for my mental training on this trick is I'll go and practice my wind up snap and then pulling in. I'm trying to really memorize this motion right here because that's going to be what pulls me into the second part of the flip. And whenever you're doing a trick in snowboarding, there's going to be a big leap of faith of like, will this actually work? Will this give me enough power? And that's even more true on doubles. So that's what we're trying to go and figure out and really unlock in the mind is how can we go and get this motion and get reassured that the trick's going to be success as early on as possible. Because if you're just throwing a backside 720, when you're learning it, your spot probably isn't going to be too locked in. So, there's going to be a moment of unknown and that moment of unknown can really mess up your whole form. So, we want to be able to go and use our visualization so we can go and train our takeoffs, train every part of the trick so we feel confident throughout that first portion of the trick. Then, we spot for the landing and we're like, \"Okay, we do got this. So, let me go and hit that other mental training and pull in.\" And this video will go and lead into the fear that comes into it because ideally, you're doing your visualization detailed enough and realistic enough. that's triggering that fear sense in your brain, that little bit of anxiety that hits your chest. I remember many nights countless where I've been was visualizing my tricks and I'd get myself so scared I wasn't able to sleep.

      "fullText": "hey shreders this is episode two where we go and break down my snowboarding Through The Years pointing out the mistakes how I went and addressed them and how I went and learned from them this is going to be covering jumps rails basically the whole season in this episode I'm 13 years old and I'm starting to hit street style rails starting to hit bigger jumps and pushing my limits as a rider and because of that I started making a lot more mistakes uh than I ever have before and I was way more sketchy I actually find that my writing from the pr year was probably less sketchy more solid where this year I'm a little bit more erratic wild I also hit a massive grow spurt what really impacts your snowboarding it's a big difference from having your like younger body versus like growing and being all janky and wonky so we're going to go and break down what I learned from this season and how you can go and apply it to your own riding so the first thing you'll notice is I'm hitting the big boy rails now starting to actually go and get some backside board slides and I really managed to progress fast in bra rails this year because in the big park at our terrain Park and this park had a little J Bar what lets you go and pull up it's basically like a half of a te bar so you can get really fast laps so I a you hit a lot of rails uh this is going to be a prime example of the problems I was having on the rails first of all I'm still hitting the rails way too slow you might remember that from the last episode I'm crawling and here too look it I'm hardly traveling down the rail you don't want to be landing on the rail more around here just going to make the rail shorter but speed is going to help you lock in traction it's going to be a lot easier and the next thing that's happening is a vast overextension of the full body when you go and extend fully like this you're going to have to go and adjust yourself to go and get that bend back in your legs because you always want to be hitting the rail with a little bit of Bend in your legs body just staying in that stacked position because a fully extended position isn't stacked over your board anymore it's too compromised and the other problem here is I'm popping up too soon see how I'm fully extended before the tail of my snowboard po off the snow so this means I'm doing this full motion for absolutely nothing not getting anything out of it and still made it pretty close to the end there and that's just because it was still a pretty straight takeoff but you can see my arms got disconnected here I'm trying a trick I was not ready for and you know you're not ready for a trick uh when you're double hands touching almost toe catching the whole way I'm pretty sure I was trying to front one on c one out it's been a couple of minutes since I Tri this one so it's a little bit fuzzy but the main issues here are just a little bit nervous so I'm throwing my upper body too soon making it so I'm not actually using any of that momentum to help me get that rotation around and that's making it so I need to rely on counter rotation was great for finishing a spin but if you're not in the proper position to use it it's going to throw off your balance and access rotation and that's why I'm landing with this weird foot sort of angled down and that's why I'm not balanc throughout the full duration of the rail just snapping too soon that's a big problem you're going to see in a lot of my snow here I'm not confident enough to go and do my snap when I'm supposed to this has a lot to do with moving on to the bigger features the bigger terrain and we can really see it with this backside 360 here uh just hectic and loose so why is this bad aide 360 so freaking uh terrifying uh it's going to be for a few reasons I think we have another shot showing it from a back angle to look at in a sec but first of all look at how stationary my upper body is instead of having my upper body continue about rotation or snap instead all that H is happening is I'm dropping my shoulder and I'm dropping my head so I'm basically trying to rotate this whole 360 just by going and pulling my head down underneath my shoulder and this is causing me to go and get no rotation off the takeoff and that's why I need to go and use my whole core and everything to bring it around so that's just not properly performing the takeoff here we have the back angle and you can see why this isn't a sustainable way to be spinning uh so first look at how Ro way that is crunched over that's causing pre- drift that's causing me to lose that tallness making me lean forward and lose power it's also going to make it so it's impossible to go and pop with any power because imagine if you did a full power pop from the bent over position it throw you straight into a MTI what isn't going to work especially with this out of a takeoff so causing a scuff takeoff off no power off the takeoff because I'm too bent over and that's making it so I need to get my head spot on the knuckle and use every muscle in my body to get a rotation around so this is the year where I heel caught on a backside 360 and that's where you go up a takeoff rotate too soon catch your heels and get launched backwards back to a knuckle and it really hurt me and it really messed with my head for a long duration of time and it made me really nervous to be patient on the take off what's going to be a problem that's true for a lot of my ring but the plus side is since I've been riding the bigger rails I've started to go and get more uh flowy on the boxes and stuff one thing I really want to note here is even though I'm doing a front board switch up I can't front board at this point I just learned that if you go and continue momentum you can keep rotating keep flat but it's a lot of years before I can front board from this and here I think a prime example of showing what my season was all about at this stage and that's popping up trying to hit something sick and not having the skill to go and perform it so what you should be learning and taking away from this year is take it slow focus on those fundamentals it's good to push yourself but if you're going in using improper form it's going to lead to unnecessary injuries but will go and give you mental blocks that will be hard to overcome in the future because this takeoff here is a bit better straighter but I'm still making the same dipping shoulder mistake leaning forward and I could have fixed this mistake on a smaller jump on flat ground at home instead of needing to go and do it off of the jump little going big because this drop shoulder and this head position where my head's leaning away from a torso is never going to work for any spin so if you have a problem like this in your own riding spot it address it and fix it in the least risky situation possible because that will really go and save you a lot of hardship so here we have the same like backside 270 on that I tried in the past you can see I'm still Landing very on top of the feature missing rotation and getting crumpled but I got double camera angle so we're upgrading and yeah um this really hurt and this is why rideon features are actually pretty gnarly and that's because we still have little Clips in the front that you can go and hit so here I was just trying to backboard I jumped too soon clipped that little Edge and banged my knee banged my face and just this really traumatized me from rails and actually may me scared of rails for a really long time and that's why it's so important to take these proper steps and learn your progression safely because a fall okay we let me finish that train of thought a fall isn't going to just go and hurt you in the meantime it's going to hurt your long-term progression the more you go and get wrecked the scare your snowb is going to be so you want to learn as safe as possible that's why these wild cats should have not be attempted uh we'll go and break it down it's sort of meeme at this point to just go and break down my failed Flips For Those you that no know because I haven't told anyone uh I actually had a very large flip phobia when I was a kid I went and got dropped on my head cement my first time ever trying to back flip and I'm be terrified to go over backwards so I always would only try inverts in very weird conditions so here I felt okay drop trying it because it was a small jump no pop and inch powder but the problem is it's a small jump no pop uh inja powder so what happens here is I just want to get in the back fli around I go and lean all the way on my back foot when you're this leaned over you're not going to be to generate any power you need to be centered on your snowboard shifting about weight to your back foot not leaning into it and that's making it so I just get eaten on the takeoff get no pop and I get no rotation around so not a very good attempt probably as high of a chance of working out as these te dogs and stuff so you can see still at this point no ability to flip or anything and I want to talk this a little bit I was riding this day and I went and hit a tree and went for a slash and a slush Cliff got thrown into the bushes got my board up hit a tree but it like seized my back and it got trapped under snow and buried and the reason why I'm mentioning this is because how you're going to get her usually isn't trying to do something where your focus is there 100% it's usually going to come from something that you're taking for granted so if you like sort of got something but not really just enough that you can stop thinking about it that's what can get get you so remember be safe especially when the conditions are variable if it's a bad flatlight day sticky snow for features just aren't groomed right note that because we want to go and train and get our tricks as easily and safely as possible to not go and try get any of these mental blocks that you get from having an injury mental blocks are going to be a little bit of a bigger deal for kids it just goes and gets ingrained a little bit more but it's true for adults as well so go respect your body respect your process of learning these tricks and progress in the way if you go and train a principle on something smaller do it because when you move to a bigger feature a bigger trick it's going to make it that much easier so that's a big takeaway from this year take your time to learn your fundamentals and then you can go and apply that to bigger stuff in the future and hit your rails fast and don't break up the waist awesome well thanks for watching the video guys uh we're going to do another one these are really easy for me to make because I already edited everything together so we'll keep doing it let me know if you like this style of content learn something new and what you want to see in the future I'm planning on really going beast mode on this YouTube channel and I'm excited to do it on that note I have a patreon now uh I don't need any funding for it it's just to go and hopefully pay for some filmers so I can make some more high production videos uh this season I'm planning on funding as much of it as I can myself that said I figured I'd put it out there if anyone in the community wants to support it help the videos get that much better it'd be greatly appreciated but it's not needed it's not for my life or anything it's just money to go to making more snowbo content for YouTube so don't feel pressured and as always

That's why we can go and use these big bounces to generate height, but when we're doing our actual tricks, we want to maintain our balance over the balls of our feet. So, when you're bouncing, you're not fully extending everything straight. Instead, you're keeping a little bit of hinge in the upper body, a little bit of bend in your legs, and this lets you rotate over the balls of your feet, and that's going to give you a lot more similar uh bounce and rotation access that you'll find on a snowboard. And the next thing we're going to do is just not over bounce. We don't want to be bouncing all over the trampoline and then trying to do our tricks because it's going to throw us off. So, I recommend using the free or four bounce system. That's why you just start flat and you go one, two, three, throwing your trick on the third bounce.",

Here I close off a little bit too soon and this is making it so my head's looking up and over my shoulder. Everything's connected and stiff and that's causing me to go and start preemptively rotating. Here we have a really sick front side 360 by Mons Royland. And I want you to pay attention to a couple things. First, look at how much bend he's keeping in his upper body, trying to keep his weight as stacked over top of his board as possible. Next, look at how patient he is closing off his front arm. He's keeping himself completely closed, and that's making it so he has a really large range of motion to play with. So when he pops off, he's leaving chest, not even rotated 90. This is a big jump and he's using a lot of upward momentum to get it inverted. But this is the same principles we want to be using. It's not about going and snapping hard. It's about snapping with a flexible enough range of motion that you can carry your momentum without going and overextending your upper body. So, the difference between me and my friend here is when I'm going and snapping my spin, I'm continuing that momentum all the way through where all of his power is being used to push upwards. So, I still have a bit of rotation of the tank and I'm going continue that rotation right there off the lip. See how my front arm is now pulling? My chest is leading. My hips are following instead of being in this straight position. One other major thing you're going to notice here is the hinge in my upper body is way more pronounced.",

      "fullText": "in this video we're going to break down one of my patreon members straight airs to see how he can improve currently your fundamentals are looking really solid you're hitting a lot of the key points I'm looking for on every straight air even with f b you're still Landing nose heavy sometimes tail heavy sometimes and every time heel heavy so let's break down why this is happening first your in Run's awesome you're doing a little bit of heels to toes so you're not holding too much toe pressure you're going and adding a nice amount of Bend to your legs and you're keeping your shoulders completely squared this whole inun portion of your jumping is money no need to change any of it and your extension and forward leading is also really close your problem here is your timing currently as you're extending your body you're going on holding a maximum extended state for a extended period of Time how snowb works is building off momentum so the fact that you're coming in and getting into your maximum extended uh position while your board's still making contact with the snow means that you're not getting any that effective range of motion or any of that power generated from going from a more squatted down position to a more upright position so it's basically the same as if you riding into the jump and hitting the jump completely in this position go and take this position take it from the in run and take it the whole way off the Jump that's exactly what you're doing here because you're holding this position longer than you need to and this is causing a couple more problems extending your legs this early the first one is going to be that you're going and popping off the lip early and you're not fully making contact with the lip of a jump as long as you can so see here how your board is leaving off the end of a takeoff early this does a couple things that are going to really hurt your jump first of all it's making it so you're not utilizing this whole section of the jump what's the most kicky most poppy powerful part of the jump and when you don't go and match the takeoff of a jump not only do you get less power from it but you also don't match the angle of the takeoff and by not matching the angle of the takeoff is why you're Landing tail heavy and nose heavy how jumping works is if you go and match the angle of the takeoff of the jump so see here how my board is making contact with the tail and it snaps off the end and is on the exact angle of the jump that's going to make it so your Arc in the air sinks up perfectly of the landing and that's why I'm able to jump without needing to make any microc controls and land in this neutral position but there's a couple more things going on here as well because you're popping and fully extending it's going and making it your weights being set over to your heel Edge so how snow works is you can only really keep pressure on your toe Edge through leaning or through keeping a little bit of bending your legs a little bit of hinge forward in order to keep your Center Mass on the balls of your feet and what you want to do in the park on every jump is be in that balls of a feet position pop without losing it maintain it through the air and that's going to let you hit the landing with it and that's how you get this tow Edge Landing but because you're going and extending so much off the lip of the jum jump it's actually going and pulling your center of mass closer towards your heels and because your center of mass is towards your heels it's going to make it really hard to control of a jump and as you come into that Landing you're going to be landing heel heavy so see here how your whole body is angled towards your heel Edge if we compare that to mine I'm straight set over my toes so the fix we're going to need to make for you is twofold first we need to make it so you're going and starting your extension later I'd recommend for this not worrying about extension take this position here and just focus on maintaining contact with your board and the lip of a jump until you SL go and pop off the end because that will give you already more height than you're getting right now because you're not actually utilizing any of this range of motion in your legs and you're not fully utilizing the lip because your board's popping off slightly early so for now just focus on holding your stack position waight over footballs your feet so like this position right here and trying to hold your tail pressure into it goes and snaps off the end once you start getting more comfortable fat then we'll start adding the pop and as you pop I want you to go and lessen your range of motion right now you're going in popping until your legs are fully extended and you're also shifting your upper body too far to your front foot see right here you're going and doing your upper body shift towards your front foot what you need to do on every straight air to go and get into that Landing because we go and need to shift our weight slightly to our back foot to maintain tail pressure so the general idea of that is correct but the way you're doing it is making it your weight is set more towards your front foot and what you need to be doing is making sure that your weight is set towards the center of your board so here my front foot's straighter my back leg's more bent and I'm compensating for this by letting my upper body tilt forward all while maintaining this little bit of lean forward in my upper body that keeps my Center Mass over tops of the balls my feet where What's Happening Here is you're going and popping up so much and shifting your upper body forward it's angling you adding a little bit of Bend to your core and you're letting your arms come up over your head what's dis balancing you as well and all this is resulting in your Center Mass being set too far to your nose and too much towards the heels of your snowboard so how do we go and fix this we fix this just by doing less you have your perfect stack position right here I want you to practice going and maintaining contact with the jump coasting and then slowly continue to add a little bit more pop a little bit more power not so much that your legs fully extend and get like leg locked and not so much that it starts pulling your arms up over your head just enough that you can go and generate a little bit of extra power a little bit of extra lift and push against the jump because the only problem with coasting and the only way you would make it so you get less staple and less air than what you're doing right now is if you let the jump go and buck your legs and pull you down so the secret and the key to going and getting your straighter to the next level is doing less you're popping too soon making so you're not fully utilizing your power so let's go and really slow down this duration of pop and let's also lessen your point of Maximum extension if you went and had your point of Maximum extension right here we wouldn't be making this video because your straight airs would be absolutely baller the only thing I'd go and note with this is because you're used to going extending your leg so much in order to compensate for this you're letting your upper body lean forward and hinge forward more in an attempt to keep your weight more set over the balls of your feet so when you're going and doing a less of a jump remember that you don't need to have quite as much hinge forward in the upper body and instead you can get the same pressure by just going and maintaining a little bit more Bend in your legs and then pushing through that because as you go and pop you don't want to go and have your upper body too lean forward you can see that I'm keeping a little bit of a neutral position nothing super aggressive and that's going and giving me all the control I need and all the power I need so everything you're doing is right just go and do it a little B bit less try to really focus on pushing that tail into the jump and try to focus on not overextending yourself do this and your straight errors are going to be absolutely money because the key principles of having absolutely fantastic straight airs are there and if you need any more feedback let me know and for anyone watching this video this is a service I offer to my patreon members simply go and sign up to

worked and drained at this point in the trip for 2 days in a row I haven't recovered from my cords tight my necks Whiplash my shoulders feel heavy but I've been in this kind of body and mental state many times before and being able to have great days from it so we're going to go focus on just doing some straight air 360s trying to get used to the bag and building up some there I got a popsicle and trying to get some [Music] [Music] done all [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now will [Music] up top on the mega ramp and it's pretty dope the hardest part is draw in it's around 3 seconds of air time and a lot of steps 62 steps to get up here and I did like six hits so far really feeling it but the jump feels good nice transition not too Ticky we're going to go and try to get some spins going [Music] first spin was pretty gnarly uh a little bit too heavy on the tail wedge and it's definitely a big jump you can feel the speed and the power coming through a little of the takeoff but first one out of the way that's always the hardest going to try to get more over to the left so I can get on my heels sooner and hope transition toe sooner and hopefully that makes it [Music] [Applause] easier my heart is full of hope I'm on my way and the star so here I am I'm about to explore I feel like must I never before I sa not chance on my my heart is full of hope I'm on my way and I'm stop [Music] holy freaking guys I just tried my first ever triples on anything I've never tried to Triple anything in my life and it's like one of those things I've been thinking about doing it for so long that's so long that I was like do I even do I even have the mental capability the go Aon as to go and send a triple flip like the amount of sleepest nights I've had visualizing it thinking about it and then today I did my back sevens when I did one D back 10 I'm like that felt like the access looked at the video it's exactly the access I had in my mind but I wanted to like do a triple on like screw it I'm going to try a triple right here right now and as soon as I had that F I was like laded felt like I was going to faint puke trips me out being here and been trying something but I've been thinking about for so long I came into his trip wanted to do the back triple think I got it but being here surrounded by like so many good Riders and like the airbags being more scar than I fought had me thinking like maybe I don't got it maybe it's like bit on my league but went and snapped it and first two really sketchy form but I changed my angle of takeoff to be over my tail and that was like way better so not only do I have the mental capability to go and commit to the triple but I have the mental capability to adjust it and tweak it so that means I have the ability to learn it and this experience this attempt trying the bags is only possible because of this facility because of the airbags if I went and tried this on snow but I was planning on doing I've been planning on trying on snow for like four years but I just never had the day never had the opportunity and if I did try on snow I would have gotten hurt pretty bad so to come here figure out that problem with my logic and do it safely build that confidence so my first experience of the trick isn't getting hurt but instead my first experience with it is excitement and joy and that is so valuable to me and really just makes me appreciate this facility because with how my life was going I don't think without an airbag I ever would have tried the back triple and I definitely would have ever landed it so feeling very appreciative and happy with myself today so thank you everyone for like supporting this blog watching it and just yeah being so supportive of me being here I really appreciate it those a little compliments and little bits of encouragement are really help and to really stacked up so I'm really just really feeling grateful about life right now and I'm happy that I went and had the opportunity to share it with some people and hopefully inspires you to get out there and keep chasing your riding dreams because it's definitely possible and if you keep working towards it you'll be able to get it done thanks for watching J like the letter I'm making several wavs I know the mission the same I made it SP all my pass last like running the race you say I keep it coming like this a

going taking I keep the stars and we going farther like and phly we throwing it deep this only possible through other the obstacles I went H and I found me some peace it's why my reflection is rocking the cheese now that the adrenaline's calmed down a little bit let's go and break down what happened on these back triple attempts what can be learned from it and what changes do I need to make in order to bring this to snow so the first thing I want to highlight is why I tried this triple normally I'd go put a lot of Basics I was sort of planning on only doing 360s today but I did this duback 10 and it had almost no R and most importantly it had an access rotation but I figured would work for the back triple see how it's really flippy here pulling into a back flip I figured that'd be perfect for pulling into a third flip because then I'd be able to pull into a third flip like I do normally for my second flip so I was like okay that's it once I figured out that I'm going to try the back triple all I was telling myself was patient and commit to the free disc whenever you're doing a double triple it's really important to go dip for each one of the flips because you're going to be able to go and get to a safer position than if you go and pull out so you always want to commit but let's go and break down this first one to see why it didn't work out I'm coming into the jump and I'm not completely stacked over my snowboard I got a little bit of lean and then as I go to throw this trick I really lean down towards my board and you can see how I'm not stacked over my snowboard remotely this is going to have a couple of out effects first of all you just don't get as much strength when you're going and throwing this far away from your board because you don't have the use of your hips and glutes so this is basically a complete upper body throw downward the issue with doing it this way as well is it's making it so your momentum is being thrown off your Edge to the side it's going to cause drifting every single time as well as making the trick very flippy my goal was to do the trick flippy because I thought it work better for the third portion of the trick but you can see the reason why this didn't really work is I'm finishing the spin with the flip instead of like spinning out you don't want to be finishing uh your flip as a last thing because it's more dangerous if you under rotate your flip you're going nose pick it's going to be a bad time so it's better to go and be finishing your rotations in a spin because that's going to give you a larger area of mistakes because when you're spinning you can over rotate a little bit more under rotate a little bit more but when you're flipping you're really committed to getting the perfect access rotation so that's just too Flippy and I wouldn't want to try it on snow because you would have to be very very precise with how much rotation you got so this next one I tried to go and spin it a little bit more uh and it still had pretty similar results I went and threw down pretty much in the same way a little more stacked but still throwing down towards the board pulling into the tricks Flip Flip and what was really cool about these back triples is I actually was was able to keep vision of the landing the whole time so after I snapped and pulled into it like a double I was actually able to keep my eyes tracked on the knuckle the whole time was one of my biggest fears is that my Axis rotation wouldn't let me see the whole way so being it just fought the full duration of a spin makes it way safer way more controllable but that one was also too flippy so what I went to do to change this is one particular thing and that was Focus all of my energy on trying to stay stacked over my snowboard completely not throwing down but instead throwing over my tail because in Fury that should go and get more rotation out of the hips more rotation out of the upper body and let you get a cleaner pull through the spin so I did that pretty well here uh still you can see I'm leaning forward I'm making like a little a between the jump so this is still too far down and I'll need to be more stacked over my board trying this in the future but this had a way better effect on drift and on rotation so first looking at the drift I'm hardly drifting at all this is an acceptable amount of drift ideally you're Landing in the center because more sideways momentum makes it harder to not land on your heels and when you're Landing off a big impact like this onto your heel Edge it's going to be hard to stomp but you can see that the rotation is coming around a lot better finishing with the spin and flip around the same time uh but it's a little bit not enough flip so I landed heels here and then went back and fell over a little bit so that one's going to land on snow but with a little bit more air time it definitely could have be so what am I going to do to go and change these back triples in order to make them so I can actually Stomp Them first things first is a setup carve I'm going to try go and add more Bend to my legs keeping more stack of my board so I don't have this early on position where I'm super uh pivoted because that's making it so when I transition to my toes I have a lot of sideways momentum I need to just first by hinging at the hips so I'm going to try to stay more tall and stack through a spoon of a jump through an in run hopefully that'll let me stay more stacked going up and doing my wind up and then I'm going to focus on throwing it more like a spin instead of a double cork so my doubles and triples I'm throwing too much down like a flip I got to throw this more like a spin not rounding in the spine staying straighter taller over the T and that should put me on a more spinny axis which should be easier to land but this was probably one of the best days of my life I've been really wanted to try this trick and I'm just going to talk a little bit about the process of doing a trick like this the most important thing is fully believing you can do it so as I went to go drop into a trick first I was like I think I got this then I was like okay I do got this then I'm like okay I'm going to do it and then it's like I got got this easily you really need to go into a jump not with I think but I know and you need to go in with the 100% commitment to throw that's why trying tricks for a first time is more gnarly because once you have it like familiar you don't need to be as fully committed to trying it because you have a bit more of a reference but I always have best success when trying doubles to make sure that I commit no matter what and the most important thing to being able to commit no matter what is making sure that you have a good takeoff so when I'm trying to add a new rotation new flip like this there's two things that I tell myself first be patient and calm on the takeoff uh because if you go and hook start drifting scuff that's going to be something that could really devastate you if you commit to a trick and the next is just committing to the Head dip so here I did three dips coming into the jump so before dropping in I made sure to practice that motion visualize it with my eyes closed with my eyes open just trying to get the full feel of the trick mentally before dropping in and that will drastically increase the amount of times you commit to the trick so when you're trying to Big trick trying a new flip make sure to take your time visualize it and tell yourself you can do it you got this trick and then take a step back from the trip and make sure to focus on your takeoff because all spins involve around them and with that mindset they'll be able to get your first attempts out of the way and then from there you can go back look at the footage and improve it and figure out what's works so hopefully you're able to use this information to improve your riding I'm going to use it to try land my first back triple",

      "fullText": "If we jump into a board slide set over our heels, we're going to fall backwards. So that's why we really want to exaggerate pulling that upper body forward. So I want you to try get that range of motion, add a little bit more bend, add a little more more upper body forward than you expect, trying to keep your chest in line with your knees. And from there, you can go and counter rotate through. Now let's talk a little bit of a counter rotation because this is what really gets a lot of people because it's the trick itself. So, there's a couple ways you can do counter rotation. First, you can start with your upper body twisted and just let your legs follow. Uh, that's not too ideal, though, because you're not using your pop, your range of motion. And if you have your upper body twisted, it's a lot harder to keep your weight set in that right position. So, what I recommend practicing is lining up your pop with your counter rotation. This does a couple of things. By going and lining up when you're popping with your counter rotation, it's going to give you more lift. It's going to keep you more squared, what's letting you get a cleaner line off the jump. And then it's also going to let you go and pull your arms back. So, that's a very important part on every backside board slide is making sure as you pop up, you're counter rotating, pulling your arms this way. If you land with your arms like this, it's easy to pull it back to regular. But if you land with your arms in a neutral position or closed off, it's going to be very incredibly hard to pull it back. So, how do we want to train this? How much do we want to rep it? The answer is you don't need to train it too much. just a little bit a few times a week will really help. So when you're training your backside board slide, go add more bend to your legs.",

      "fullText": "video we're going to learn from one of the goats of snowboarding offer Longo and we're breaking down his side hit Euphoria to try to figure out the techniques he uses to be the king of side hits side hits are referring to these little hits you can find of the mountain usually small takeoffs and even smaller Transitions and arer Longo is probably the best side hit rider in the world so let's go break it down and see what kind of techniques he's using to go and hit these awesome airs and these awesome pops I'm very excited he's one of my favorite snowboarders so it's going to be such a joy to go and figure out how he does what he does we'll go and start with this little Ollie at the start here uh this is going to be very similar to a takeoffs and form he uses on everything uh generally allies are a little bit more aggressive off the tail than you'll be doing for a lot of side hits because side hits have such a short transition it's hard to go get that full Flex what I find really interesting about is Ali is how neutral the position he has normally you want to set your weight forward and then you do a shift to your back foot and then you pop up a full range of motion but he's staying very centered in his snowboard and as he pops up yes he's moving towards his back foot but he's not moving towards his back foot in a very noticeable way so as he's going in popping up here he's holding a very straight line of his whole body not much back and forth motion so this is a lot more similar to like the pop you'd be seeing off of a jump relying on just that pop extension off the tail but it's very subtle and very tall being really tall over the board like this is letting him put more power straight up and it's a smaller more controllable motion so even with this max power oie his movement is very minimal and I think this is one of the keys to why he's so good at side hits so let's go and break that down for here so he's coming in and we can see a very similar position but less aggressive less leaned over around the same amount of Bend in the legs uh this is just because it's a really kicky side hit here so he doesn't want to be bent down too much or else he won't be able to absorb the gForce going through the spoon of the jump so he's holding a very strong position and completely squared see his shoulder is completely squared back arm a little bit open uh the reason why he's going and having his chest a little bit open like this is because it's a hip based Landing so he needs to have his upper body preemptively open a bit so as he pops up his board will naturally rotate to his upper body angle so that's just a little preemptive motion and now let's see this pop boom just power extension so the really cool thing that we're noticing about Vis pop is look at how little of a range of motion he's doing with getting this much power and the reason why this works is because his body keeps extending up into this point and at this point the energy is now being driven into the tail making it snap off the end we can see that his board is matching the same angle as the takeoff the whole way see how his nose isn't lifting that's how we know he isn't doing an ollie because his board isn't flexing we we also know that he's going and leaving perfectly off the back tail because his nose isn't dipping if he jumped a little bit front foot first a little bit letting that tail of his snowboard come up that would drop his nose but because his nose of the snowboard is maintaining the same angle as a takeoff the whole way that's telling us that he's doing a perfect takeoff and it shows where power comes from from taking off even though he's doing a massive hit like this getting Max height instead of trying to do an Allie he's just holding a strong position pushing through that jump pushing off his tail and letting that tail snap off and look at this he waits really patiently for the jump to go and finish the G's and then he brings his up legs up to him from this point here he could hit any grab like look his hand are right there if you want to grab here he definitely could so that's a choice not grabbing at that point and see how his board slightly rotated that's reing the effects of uh him coming off the takeoff of that slight leg position and let's break down this Landing oh my goodness this Landing is sniper so he's doing a couple things to land here first he's making sure that he has full extension in the legs and while he's doing this he's keeping his upper body leaned a little bit forward when you're keeping your legs extended like this you still want you have that little bit of hinge in your upper body because as you go and squat to absorb the impact of the landing right here you need to make sure that your weight isn't being set too far over your heels so here he actually gets a little bit close to slipping out heel heavy see how his weight set over there so this is why it's so important to go and keep your weight slightly over that balls your feet because if he didn't have this slight hinging of his upper body he would have fallen to his butt for sure but why is he Landing a little bit more heal heavy here I think the reason why he's Landing a bit heal heavy here is look at how bumpy this in run is and plus he's going on a slight angle with a un consistent Landing so he's Landing a little bit on his heel heels to deal with that angle if he landed fully on his toes his toes would probably just dig in and he'd get bucked and then he's also Landing very much on his back foot but this is a really oh sorry about that uh this is a really cool thing he's doing when he lands on his back foot and it's keeping his upper body still in a neutral position so even though he's in this back foot position he's actually rocked his upper body a little bit forward so as he lands even though it's back foot his body's pulling him forward and that's really the key to like Landing these tail heavy Landings in powder is even though you're Landing back foot heavy you're shifting your weight over to your front foot here he's getting bucked you at tail because he like hits impact and it bucks him but because his upper body is set over balls of his feet and forward he's able to power through and just lace it awesome side hit so awesome now this one's really cool little side hit off his transition so what's he doing here again we can see he's in an even more bent down position with his upper body than he was uh for his straighter this is because he's trying to set his axis rotation over the balls of his feet and he's doing a Hardway front one so as he goes and Pops this Hardway front one he's coming and extending but look at how his weight is still set at the same point here just fully extended now so this is really interesting he's using a very big torso extension and rotating his body 90 getting full extension of the legs and this will set him up to use counter rotation really well so let's watch his arms does he counter rotate y so counter rotates back in so that's really cool what he's doing here is instead of going and trying to throw this front one like a spin instead he's trying to throw it like a straight air where he's opening his upper body completely as he goes and pops up he keeps that up body rotating slightly all the way into the air fully extended and from this point his board isn't spinning he's actually only getting this 180 around through counter rotation and that's why we see his arm coming back the reason why he's doing this is because it gives you more control counter rotating a spin instead of trying to rotate because if you're rotating the whole way then that rotation is decided on your takeoff so your takeoff set speed of rotation is going to play a big impact but by removing it and making it a fully counter rotated Ro spin he knows exactly how much rotation he's going to get how much he's going to get it letting him get perfect timing perfect transition because look at how small that Landing is and then yeah just keeping completely stacked over the board so that's really interesting here he's not going and shifting his body to land into his downhill pitch so his upper body isn't positioned like he's Landing here and that's probably because it would make him nose pick so what he's doing instead is holding this neutral strong position holding the position he'll want to be landing in at the flat part of the landing so as he goes and transitions through boom he's already in that position that's just because the landing so short for this one exactly the same doing switch leaned over upper body rotating completely 90 we can see this one he's doing a bit of a two-footed jump that's just because there's no lip there and precision and then exact same thing counter rotation into that landing and just hitting it perfect so that's like Tech technically not very hard but the Finesse and the features he's doing it on truly impressive he's a truly impressive dude nice little all over the sign all right let's break down this backside 360 because backside freeze on side hits are way different than back freeze on the Park first things first he's going and letting his body come over and hand dragging into it this is actually exactly the same thing as I do and as he's doing this he's holding this Edge line but there's something really interesting about this Edge line is it's not gone from turning but his whole body is angled towards this point so instead of coming in and trying to turn into it he preemptively angled his whole body so now it's like doing a straight line with that little bit of edge in but on a backside spin you can't hold a tow Edge too long without going and slowly breaking down so that's why he's going and holding this crouched over position like this but this crouched over position actually isn't a problem because sure it's a little bit unbalanced here but because he's not fully extending his legs Watch What Happens so he gets a bit of extension not full extension and as he's extending look at that rounding the spine ooh normally you don't want around your spine but this is off for Longo so let's go and see why he's doing it because there'll be a great reason behind it so his Center Mass and rotation still set over the same point as he pops off and that lets him bring his legs up here so the whole reason this works on side hits and works on a backside 360 is because even though this is improper position he's leaned over broken the weight uh curving the spine so this position here is unbalanced but as soon as he goes and brings his legs up to him right here that he's holding the same exact upper body position but because his legs come up that makes it so his Center of balance is in the correct spot so this is called a premotion he's preemptively setting his upper body into a position that will let him go and control the 360 so this position here improper but it's the exact same upper body position he'll want to be in for the 360 so he's preemptively setting his upper body into it because he knows he has plenty of air time doesn't need to generate much pop and he's relying on that back arm pulling him through bringing up the legs getting that core engaged and from this point on he's got it 100 out of a 100 times he's got that back free from that position so for something like a backside free60 you can really go and let yourself focus on being in an upper body position holy mly so backside 360 side hits focus on being in an upper body position that works for a spin because you're not going to be able to generate much snap much pop from a full form so it's okay to cheat those a little bit and you actually need to for side hits so for this one I'm not much of a flipper but look at his head positioning when he's doing this flip first he's keeping his body completely aligned see how he's not going and caving in to try throw back he's not throwing his head back into a spin instead he's keeping his eyes forward head in lined with the shoulders there that's really important for flips because look at as he comes through he's spotting this whole way a little bit blind here oh it's so blind that's so sick uh and then spots again right here so he's really relying on not throwing his head rushing that spot he spots it initially then Waits patiently to be able to spotted again and as he's spotting he's killing his rotation this is honestly going to be that's impressive uh we won't break into that too much more that strong upper body position is what you need here for a crippler off of something like this look at how chundered up that takeoff is That's So kicky that's so aggressive what does he do make sure that his body is staying completely centered over his board and as he's popping his flip he's not going and curving in he's staying tall pushing through and that's what's giving him this good air time know what let's check the head positioning on that a little bit more because the head positioning on flips is something that I see a lot of people get confused on so as he's going and throwing this uh flip look at his head he's not throwing it up and over his shoulder he's not looking over instead he's keeping a spot on the ground and tilting his whole shoulders and that's how you want to rotate these it's not by going and ah try and fling that head back instead it's keeping everything tight and trying to pull everything in together so he's doing a fantastic job for that wow sick nice we'll break this one down and the good thing to not with side hits is the kick you're of the jump the more you actually need to push into it and attack it in order to not get bucked so when it's like a park jump super casual groom perfect jump not much kick you can just Coast you don't need to do much but for a side hit like this hitting with this much speed you need to be strong and aggressive so what does he do here to make maintain the strong posture first he's not using much bending the legs and when's he entering this Bend so he entered enters that bend position pretty soon but he's really holding a nice tall posture exploding chest open why is his chest opening there so he is landing slightly heal towards the heel Edge so that could be why he's just trying to land there a important note for all these side hits and everything is your stack position isn't NE necessarily referring to being completely in line with your snowboard shoulders and everything when you're taking off with a bit little bit of toe pressure it's going to make it so your board wants to slightly turn so your stack position here would actually have your upper body a little bit open because that's going to keep your Center balance perfect so if your legs are turning one way your upper body needs to turn the other way in order to keep your Center balance at the same point so he's still taking off from a completely stacked position even though he's letting his shoulders open here but it's because he's trying to go and hit that little bit of rotation in the air to sink up with the landing and he's trying to counter that slight angle his boards taking on the jump because see how his board's angled over to the right side right now so he's opening his upper body to counter that angle and that's what's making him go up and be able to land facing this way so he was angled this way over here but he's Landing facing this way so that's why he's opening his upper body a little bit just go and counter that angle of the jump really impressive okay we'll break this one down as well so what's happening here so he's coming in good pop same pop that he uses on every one of these features and I'm just going to highlight it again look at how his board is matching the angle that takeoff his takeoff is so steep but he's not going in angling his board more angling it less instead he's pushing his board all the way off all the way through transition and that's making him leave off that tail and if this isn't proof that what you want to be doing for jumping is pushing off your tail making sure you just go and match the angle match the shape of the takeoff have your board form around it I don't know what is a great analogy uh Mikey citarelli was talking about is you want to have your board formed to the shape of the takeoff so here he's forming his board to the shape of the jump I like to think of this as like Pottery you know you're putting your hands in there and the takeoff move or the pottery moves and the clay moves as your hands touch it same thing as your board your board's rubbly it's bendy it's fible so you can actually warp your board into the shape of a takeoff mold it onto it and that's exactly what he's doing here molding his board onto the takeoff making sure it maximizes its time making contact with it and that's maximizing his height because he's not even relying on jumping or height all the way to his point and he's already a full board length up in the air and now at this point that's when the tail kicks off that's when the power that you've went and were building through the whole transition snaps and should play face and that snap does two things first it kicks you really high into the air and second it brings your legs up to you and that's the point that we want to cover here see how he's going and finishing his POP holding his finish spot position and only once he's feeling comfortable in controling the air then does he start reaching for the grab then he hits the grab and after that he tweaks it and that's a really important process pop up get in control grab then tweak if you're doing big side hits like this with a lot of buck a lot of inconsistency you need to make sure you're in control in the air before reaching for that grab especially when it's that freaking sniper we'll do one more clip but holy moly there is so much to talk about here and he is free of these so if you guys want more or for Longo breakdowns let me know but it's really just it's really just subtle precise there's nothing too special going on these are just fundamentals we're just being done absolutely perfect with amazing timing o we'll break down this front free for the last trick so he's coming in and what's he doing for his front free so first no setup carve you can't do a setup carve for a lot of these side hits but what does he do he makes sure that his shoulders and hips are closed off he has to have a little bit them a little bit open because it's slightly angled here so his body's angled but pay attention to his shoulders here closed off the whole way and look at how weight late he is to snap chest completely closed it's completely closed a board length away the reason why he's waiting like this is because as you wait it goes and makes it so it's more forgiving for carrying your momentum how popping on a snowboard works is you're only going to be rotating as fast fast off a lip as you are as your momentum goes and finishes so by going and having yourself completely closed off you increase your range of motion that you can use making it so the timing doesn't need to be as precise here he's actually not relying on much rotational momentum see how he's going and holding a very stationary position here but he's not completely stationary look at this back arm look at the shoulders even though we hardly moving they are slightly moving that combined with this fully 90 position of the upper body normally you don't need to rotate your upper body this much but the reason why he's doing this is the same reason truth was if you watched the last video and that's because he's not relying on rotation for his spin instead he's relying on pulling with his back arm and the grab and the axis with the spot to have him rotate so he really doesn't need much rotation now we're going to go and turn our attention to a spot see how his eyes are spotting forward in front of him this is very important if he went and tried to look around his shoulder and spot he'd be looking over here not getting control but because his spot is forward in front of him watch what happens as he starts to rotate his spot goes and remains at the same place but because he's going and traveling over the point that he was spotting his naturally goes and starts being back hill but this is where powder Landings and going big on front freeze is different for the blind Landing so he's been using those same principles that we use for blind Landings every single time here eyes locked in this point if he landed right here he'd be landing that blind Landing but because he set his spot point a little bit further up and he's traveling a little bit further down this is where the magic happens and this is how you can start Landing really good front freeze into rough terrain instead of keeping his eyes locked on that and looking up he lets his vision shift forward slightly so eyes locked right there and then once he starts past that point eyes shift forward so you if you watch my videos you'll hear me say you never want to be spotting forward when you're Landing like a front side 360 front side 7even but that's only considering that you didn't kill your rotational energy because he sna the spin with so much little rotational energy and he relied on that grab and leading the shoulder combined with perfect spot and perfect control and perfect like airtime he's now able to shift his view from the blind Landing over to a downhill landing and he's going to do this with his and not have him over rotate with his arms watch his arms here back arm comes through right here this arm comes so this is actually him utilizing counter rotation in his upper body to go and kill rest ofat spin rotation and this is really important because when you're Landing in powder you need to be landing looking downhill if you land looking uphill this sort of a transition this much rough you're not going to be really able to land it but through going and having a Solona 360 having a spot Point positioned slightly further up because this is where he's Landing so if he was using the blind Landing he'd be looking right here at this point but he was looking all the way back up let's go and see that point he was looking right here so he's traveling another 30 ft down down so if you want to land looking forward on front freeze there's going to be three requirements you need to make first first you need to go and make sure that you're popping and you're mostly relying on your pop to go and put you up you're not setting much rotational Force too much rotation you won't be able to kill it with counter rotation coming to The Landing next you need to make sure that your constant spot is set before your Landing be it 5 ft 10 ft this works big better on bigger jumps I normally only do front freeze on this on like 30ft jumps at the largest can do it on smaller but smaller jumps you have more rotational energy so it's going to be harder to go and let your spot continue with killing your momentum so you need to have your spot Set uh before where you're actually Landing then you use the constant spot principles and as you pass that point you let your vision continue downhill and as you let your vision continue downhill you now use your upper body to go and pull the rotation continue rotation with your upper body as your legs stay stationary so you're Now using of your rotational energy to just rotate your upper body not in correlation with your lower body and this is what's letting you land in the stack position and as he absorbs it watch this so at this point stack position see Lean Forward weight set slightly over the balls with feet and then as he goes and squats his weight is set over exactly the same point this is how you can go and land these massive drops is by making sure that your weight is set over the balls of your feet through the takeoff in the air and that will make it so through the landing you're set there and as you squat down your legs come down in correlation with your upper body coming down making sure that Center balance is set over the same place Falls especially about Falls and powder usually happen because you go and start losing traction at that point so if he had went and had his upper body come down without his legs B any more he would have been too heavy over his toes topple this way if he was too straight didn't have this squat down through the balls of his feet he would go heal heavy and it would make him go and fall down this way way so it's by having your weight set over the balls of your feet and then going and squatting through that whole range of motion that you go and get that super powerful Landing that just lets you go and stomp there's so much good stuff to talk about I don't want to drag the video on too much so let me know if we should make another one like this because there's so much to learn here like oh my God look at that there's we've hardly even got started but I'm already feeling out of breath so we'll continue it next time thanks for watching and have a good one",

Anything like riding powder or just having a fun time on a mountain, I'm in too much pain to do so, so I normally go with the Photons. But really just is personal preference. Try on all the boots. Find what fits best because that's going to really what help you progress. And then if you are riding like really massive jumps or really nonly features, you should go and get a stiffer boot because it will help protect you and keep you safe on the mountain. Boots have different styles of lacing systems, but I'll only ever recommend the double boa system. It lets you go and keep adjusting your tightness, get them tighter and instantly loosen them off, giving you serious control about the tightness of your boot and also letting you get instant relief. And you just really can't beat them. There is a system called quick lace system that you'll see where you like pull it tight. These are trash. Do not buy them. Those strings snap all the time and they're really hard to replace. The last system you have is the lace system. Some people really swear by the lace system because it lets you get the tightness exactly where you want it. The downside is it's really hard to get that tightness and I've never once seen a lace boot rider that's managed to go and get enough tightness at the shin of the boot. And I personally like not having massive calluses on my hands and can't tie a knot for the life of me. So laces are not a question. So the boa system is just the most adjustable. Quick lace system. Don't use lace system. If you're really confident of tying knots and you love tying knots, give it a go. On to just general tips and little tricks that I think make boots more comfortable and better to ride. First, you want to do your boots up while standing up. This just makes sure that your ankle is locked in there. Then you want to try and make sure that you're getting it nice and tight around. I have really skinny calves, so I'm almost maxing this out. But you don't want any gap between uh the felt here and your shin because it's just going to increase shin bang.",

This isn't a strong position. This isn't balanced because it's keeping my weight too set over my flats of my feet. So, as you go and squat down, instead of trying to keep your back straight, pushing your hips out like this, that's going to make it so if you go too far, you're going to step back. Instead, we need to let our upper body come forward in correlation to our legs going down. So, it looks something like this. I find my neutral stack position and then the more bend I have the more my upper body comes down in correlation. A good way to put this is like chest over knees and then if your chest starts getting like two over knees that's no good because that's the biggest mistake people make while trying to maintain this position and that's letting their upper body come forward non-correlation. The difference is between trying to squat a squat lack and trying to go and touch your toes. As soon as you go and break your hips and reach into this touch toe position, your back's going to be compromised. You're going to be weak and you're not going to be able to put power through your motions. So, I want you to just go and practice getting in a stack position and feeling out your range of motion.",

This is making it so as he throws his spin, he can lift his arms. And now he's getting that little bit of upward momentum. Though he's still making sure most of the force is set of a rotation. If you wanted to go and do like a front underflip, you would have kept his body 90 and thrown it up straight. But because he's trying to have it more of a spin, he's letting his upper body rotate past that 90 point. And what's really important here is he's continuing that rotation through. See how his upper body is rotating all the way until he tail snaps off? But he actually doesn't need much rotational power on this because he's going and activating a dunk. This dunking motion really speeds up a front side 540 and makes it just so much easier to get around where normally front fives are really hard to get around just spinning flat. Take usually around as much power as a front seven, a little bit less. So what's he doing here? First things first, even though he's going and dunking downward, he's making sure that his chest is fully tall. His legs are again in that like 95% extension. And see his chest is relatively over his toe edge still. This is something that people really mess up with. they'll go and put too much pressure on the heels and match their whole upper body into it.

A big misconception people have for wild cats is that you want to throw down towards your tail. But what you're actually trying to do here is jam the hips forward. And as you jam the hips forward, lift that chest up while keeping your neck connected because that's going to make it so you can naturally come in. But if you come and crunch yourself and have this neck crunch, it's going to make you weak. So if you're trying to do a wild cat, this is the best way to learn. Coming up patient on that takeoff, kicky takeoff, push your hips through, think you're trying to hip check the sky while keeping your core aligned and keeping your chest tall. You do that and you keep your head in a calm position, you're going to go and get to your feet.",

      "fullText": "hey shreders this is the first video in a series where we go and break down my writing from a kid up until now pointing out the mistakes what I was working on just how I went and got better at snowboarding because one of the things you'll find as you snowboard is even a matrick start getting bigger start getting less relatable the same Baseline mistakes people are making are true for 360s 720s 1080s it's the same mistakes just apply to a higher level and these techniques apply to higher trips so here we're going to go and look at what I struggled with growing up what I strugg with now and just how I go and approached it and improved these lessons so we're going to start with 20202 each one of these videos will be a year uh or so in my snowboarding lifeline and we'll go from there so first I'm a backside spinner backside spinning has always being my thing and I've gone through a lot of different uh forms and techniques so here is a backside 360 I didn't really bother doing money backside ones I mostly really ground out the backside 360 and we have a few massive problems here so first let's go and look at the setup carve I'm getting on my toe Edge way too seun see how I'm like getting on my tow Edge right before the spoon of a jump uh this is actually a pretty good setup carve where I'm not going and drifting off the end and keeping a straight line honestly a pretty good takeoff I degress from this point okay uh so the mistakes we're seeing here are open wound up for way too long and doing too EX iated of the snap and look it at my torso here I go from a tall position go get down and then lift up so I'm getting it upward and downward motion in these rotations and that's going to slow down my whole sideways rotational momentum and that's why we're getting disconnected here and needing to use counter rotation and that's the other thing that's happening even though the head's in the right spot arms are leaning the rotation but isn't that clean consistent pop off the Jump making it so I'm getting disconnected with my upper and lower body I'm trying to flail around the backside 360 so that's a big problem I had with my riding and there's actually a problem here that I still have today that I need to go and work on because I just noticed it and that is this front arm here my front arm is going and throwing and dropping down towards the side so well you don't want to drop your arm like this first of all if you have your arm down to your side you have less angle less like arm juice to get into rotation and it's going to have a tendency of dropping your lead shoulder lifting your back shoulder think of you a bit of a weird AIS rotation but here I go and doing a side hit so the setup carve isn't as important I go and get a good snap off the tail head leading the rotation but we're over leading the rotation here so see how the upper body snapped disconnected from the lower body causing the front leg to go up this means that I'm snapping too hard of the takeoff and that's making it so I don't have rotational power so it's coming around a bit better but still snapping too hard so this one is a lot cleaner coming in nice toe Edge good patient takeoff of a tail good head positioning but you can still see that my upper body is really rotated uh you can leave that rotated for like five sevens rotations that take longer to like catch up but for free 60s they mess you up so here first ever contest back free and this is where you can start seeing a bit more of my problems with the stressful situation and I'm starting to go and lean forward and have my body Arc what's making it so my throw is aim downwards and that's setting me to be very nose heavy coming into a landing and that's causing me to not land so that was my big problem with the jumps winding up too hard snapping too hard getting disconnected my problem for the rails this year uh is a little bit different let me just go and find it but you'll see I did this problem pretty much every single hit that's a wild thing about snow warning you can do the same mistake over and over and over I even had coaches at this point but they weren't they weren't the most established Riders so here try and backside spins on and the biggest problem I had with my rails early on is twofold first I was trying bigger tricks than I needed to when you're learning rails you just want to be doing 50-50s back boards front boards doing the progression for those tricks not trying to do two7 ofs odd uh but I didn't know better I thought it's cool but a big problem I had with my rails the second issue is I go too slow look at I'm landing on the rail I'm half on the rail half on the takeoff uh and that's just because I'm hitting the features too slow and this took me a lot of years to go and figure out speed is your friend on features so here you can see about I'm going and doing two problems popping up too soon going too slow and that's making it so I land very high on the rail you want to be landing more like here 30% closer to halfway down a rail uh very long rails obviously the exception but a little box like that you want to be hitting it with speed and confidence especially like here went to a rail and it just doesn't work you're not going to lock into a rail if you're not hitting it with enough speed uh since we're going and doing these early years here and there isn't too much going on we'll go and keep this one pretty short but here on the box same thing I'm getting on it and look at how much time I'm spending on a box I I could try the same thing same speed now and it wouldn't be going any better for me that's just how it works uh the powder riding we're not going to look too much in the carving this stuff because I didn't get too much but here coming up the rail and look it popping off it's just very slow very timid rail riding but that's part of learning I just recommend going and trying to focus Less on doing the bigger tricks and more getting comfortable with the features getting more comfortable speed and your counter rotation practicing that home at this point I wasn't doing any practice at home I didn't know what I was doing uh so here he backboards I guess we'll just break it down a little bit because I bet this is is relatable for some people out there in the audience uh so problems here are a couple front first upper body opening preemptively early I'm opening before I snap this is giving me less bang less funk in my form and next I'm going really slow Landing almost back on a takeoff with a jump and that also means I'm two foot jumping not riding off my tail using that Force instead I have my board coming off the takeoff of a same time for those of you that don't know you want to be holding contact with takeoff until your tail snaps off the end because that naturally puts you over the feature uh so here twoot jump going too slow counter rotation making it so I land completely stacked and from here you're just a passenger mode you can't really control much you just have to go up your momentum and we're going to end this video off with a make S there made the backside 360 on and that's just try on eror it took me a bunch of tries oh this front board's pretty hilarious I freaking suck at front board s especially back then but this one is actually prime example of a problem people have on front boards popping up super tall super exaggerated rotating and this is causing me to land uh towage heavy whenever you take off and fully extend your body it's going to make it so you come into a feature not ideal and then from here my spot my body position is just too tall so what I mean by too tall is look at my body weight is just set straight in a line um Vias isn't ideal is because it makes it so my weights set all the way over here what's going to cause me to fall forward onto my toe Edge so what I'd want to do here is let my hip shift out upper body come down a little bit get less uh Lean Forward on these knees and that's going to put me more stacked over the center of my snowboard so this is just me trying to be stacked over the center of my snowboard but because I have a slight bit of a lean it's actually putting me very heavy onto my toe Edge and that's really a common problem with front side board slides and just makes it really hard and other problem obviously way too slow and here are my last back side 360s of the season and this is where you start seeing the problems come that's going to really go and plague Us in the later videos in the series and that is throwing downwards breaking up the waist look at how leaned over that is rotation down and that makes it so when you throw your arms snap up and then I'm disconnecting my head from my body trying to get that spot around basically it's a fear lack of comfortability thing causing me to go break up the waist not feel in control and then trying to force rotation around and then we'll end it off with this epic tame dog attempt such an amazing I like this one just really showed that I was going to be one of the world's best snowboards from the getg go yep yes sir uh so I honestly wouldn't change anything about this first attempt you can see really set up for Success uh if I would have landed here would have went right into the trees good powder Zone and really got the first 20% of a rotation around which is really all you want on a tame dog uh I guess we'll just for the jokes go into why this didn't work uh first going too slow second soft takeoff not a good platform to generate rotation off third dropping the shoulder instead of throwing over the nose look at how I'm crumpling down uh you can't crumple down on a tame dog it's going to cause you to just fall in your face rolling your shoulder and next like where the hell was I thinking I was going to go if I did land bad so not set up for Success nor did I know how to do the trick and yeah that was basically this year my problems were hitting the rails too slow uh going and snapping the jumps too hard getting disconnected and for the next year to fix this I just kept riding and I moved on to some bigger jumps and in the next video we'll go and cover the hurdles that we had to overcome for the next season thanks for watching let me know if you like this content format and if you do we'll keep making about",

But important thing when you're coasting is that you don't let your legs come down and squat because that's going to absorb the takeoff. So, you don't need to pop up a jump, but you do need to keep your legs strong and make sure that takeoff doesn't buck you. Every time you do a spin on a snowboard, you want to finish it with counter rotation. To do this, we lead a little bit with our upper body and counter rotate. And this lets us go and get max control, max power, and get that little bit of finesse. If you go and rotate all at once, don't lead with your upper body. You're going to land all at once, and it's going to remove any ability for finesse. So lead with your upper body and finish every spin of counter rotation because it slows down your maximum rotation velocity, gives you that micro control, and it makes coming into the landing so much easier and so much safer. This one trick is going to make your front side in runs so much easier. A lot of people when doing the front side spins are coming in from this tall position, relying on leaning, and then trying to shift down into their wound up position. But this is making it so they have to go and change body positions on the in run. What you actually want to do is preemptively set your upper body into your heel edge position. So that way you don't need to go and shift your balance points and instead you can just shift from toe edge to heel edge. By adding this little bit of bend in your legs on the in run of the jump, you'll be able to go and transition to your heel edge smoother.",

So, you can go and add a little more pop. But on a low rail like this, just take a little bit of speed. Keep your upper body stationary and then rotate into it. You can really see it here. My hips are slightly slightly shifted back. Not much. We're not trying to flex our board. We're just trying to maintain tail contact so it doesn't take a big motion. And our upper body is pretty sent forward. So that way as we're coming off the lip and we go and rotate our upper body, our front foot comes down, our back foot comes up. Because if we maintain this tail contact, our board's naturally over. We really don't need to do much pop on a backside board slide. Body positioning is way more important than any kind of extension or power you can get. This stuff is a little bit easier to demonstrate with the body. So, the big problem people have with rails is they'll try to get into the backside board slide and expand up and lift. From this position, I can't really counter rotate my body. I'm too tall and extended for that. And I can't really keep my weight over my toes. So if the rail is downhill and I'm in this position, all that's going to happen is I'm going slip out. Or if my legs are too straight like this, I pull my upper body forward. My ankles are now tilting forward and then I can edge catch.

So, this is going to impact my max power on my allies. is going to go and impact my landing ability because it's just not going to let me go and fully use my athletic stance all the way into my squat position, just really limiting my range of motion. And that's the thing with either going really wide are really narrow is it's limiting your range of motion. When having a narrow stance is fun, it gives you a lot of ability to rotate your hips, utilize your counter rotation, letting you get super fast rotations on your board, it's not going to be good for going and building your fundamentals and building your bigger tricks. So, if you're trying to do anything but ride rails, I really recommend not going as narrow as you can because it's just going to limit your range of motion too much. The reason why you ride duck foot is because it makes it so it feels exactly the same switch as regular because you have the same open angles. So, in theory, it feels the same, but most people rock this at like 15. And that's very aggressive. The reason why we don't really want both feet out this much angle is because it's going to rotate your ankles more and your knees more, making it so every movement you do, everything that's being done is more strain on your knees. So, like it's super ral, super controllable, but I wouldn't really want to be rocking 155 all day. So, here we are with Maxboard Lean, and you can really see that it's making it so my binding's super angled towards my boot. This is going to make it so when I go and put pressure onto my heel back, I'm putting a ton of leverage on this narrow point right here. The more leverage you put on the top here, the more it's going to turn you. So, max forward lean is going to make it so your heel side turns are super responsive and it's going to try to force you to ride more on your tow edge. A max forward lean isn't very recommended because it's going to make it so your board's very responsive. So, we're just going to go and demonstrate what it's like to ride in [Music] [Music] that quads are absolutely burning. The fact that you have to ride with like your legs like this the whole time with a forward lean because it's forcing you to bend. Just no relief, no tension, that's so painful. I can't believe how much my quads are burning in such a short period of time. Uh max forward lean not the move. Somewhere in the middle is where you want to be. For all the reasons we discussed in this video is why I ride the stance I do. And that's 21 in perfect reference stance.",

there's two things that I'm really anxious about first of all I haven't snowboarded in over 6 months so I'm hoping that I won't be too ridiculously Rusty there's no warm-up carving or anything just straight airbag to jum the second thing is I've never ridden fake snow or Landing airbags so I heard heard that this fake snow feels really similar to actual snowboarding and most people haven't had any issue with it that said it's a new experience so I'm nervous about that just checked out the airbags for the first time and very looking pretty intimidating and very a lot more expensive than I was expecting you should pay an extra $50 usage fee so that's adding more money into the Daye that's also the mega mega ramp that I'm hoping should be riding most of the time is more expensive than I was anticipating so the day average is going to be more expensive also the airbags are looking more intimidating than I expected uh the takeoffs are super narrow and The Landings are pretty small so it's not going to be very forgiving for any form of drifting and that's my biggest problem with my backside spins so going to need to get those dialed in before I can go and move on to bigger tricks but we're going to go start with the small bag or the big bag and then just go work up some straight airs work up some back freeze get used to this fake snow then move to the next size bag and if we can get some good spins off of that then the next days we'll go and move on to the biggest bag and hopefully start adding some more rotations to my snow buing [Music] finishing up on the smaller bag didn't really go how I was hoping B taking a lot more attempts to get my form uh how it needs to be I feel for a bigger bag but we're running out of sunlight and I really want to get some back sevs on that big bag before uh ending the day so I can go and think on it and visualize it so we're going to go warm up on that and see what we can get going before it gets dark [Applause] what I'm really noticing is The Edge pressure I use is almost non-existent and you see a lot of pre-s spinning on all the spins because we're staying so flat-based it's really forgiving for flat baseness but as soon as you dig in an edge it really goes in and exaggerates it with that plastic snow so going to need to go step back and change that because that's something I'm really bad for is relying on my Edge that's how I learned to do it and I'm going to have to go and change out a bit if I want to be getting these big tricks what I noticed all these Riders are doing is holding the heal Ed as soon as we're like through it downhill and holding that super light heel Edge through a whole duration where I'm going flat base and been doing a slight heel Edge what a problem I normally have but it's just is super exaggerated on uh the dry [Music] slope I've been stuck inside my house too long stand being [Music] hours ready to go now all my way I won't let fear hold me back all my all of my dreams and now step [Music] [Music] [Applause] at the end of the world there's something I can learn some good [Music] ideas I'm going it take me to people that will trust me I've been stuck inside my house too long can't stand being all alone wasting hours on my phone it C down on my way I won't let and we're finished with day one it was a pretty big day I did around 38 hits so that's way more than I was expecting I was s expecting to get 10 to like 20 hits here but that truck really boosts you up and could have went going a bit longer uh well not longer it's CL but could get a bit more efficient so hopefully we'll be able to get like 45 hits next time but a lot better than I was expecting that's getting to still pretty expensive a hit around like7 $6 a hit but way better than like $20 a hit so I'm pretty stoked on that and managed to go and have a pretty good session uh went and just focused on the stuff I know focused on just not changing too much and my takeoffs are feeling good but there's one thing that I've went and spotted but I will drastically need to change in order to get these triples and that is switching edges uh too aggressively and not holding the toe Edge and flat base long enough so I'm going to go think about that overnight visualize it and then hopefully go and get it next time because I'm feeling good on the airbags I have a lot more power to give I think these triples can be possible for me and these bigger spins are available but I need to go and figure out how to go and build up and load the setup carve and load my wind up way more so I can go and utilize my power because right now I don't have my full range of motion but it was a good first session ended up getting everything except for the flat 10 and uh d flat 12 so we'll go and clean up that drift and then get those spins and then build up to a bigger airbag and then hopefully get some 14s and bigger tricks going so it was a good day first day airbag and ever and it is a game changer like I don't want to set anything too soon but like you can't get 38 hits that exactly the same that fast with that kind of consistently and that low risk it let me go and really focus in on not focusing on needing to land a trick but focus a bit more of a trick I noed my D back 10 I was feeling way more a wearing the air just feeling way more conscious it's also my first day riding in s months so it could just be like that feeling I always find the first days I like that but pretty interesting we'll go and add a little bit more to this later once we've had a chance to over go over all the footage to show you guys what I mean with these takeoffs I'm going to go and show you example of what the people here in Japan are doing on their takeoffs so a takeoff on the right here is I'd consider a worse takeoff than mine but it has no drift what is the main thing we're focusing on and I've been noticed this on all the Japanese Riders as well and they are much better Riders than I am some of the National Team guys are here so they're good and when you see good Riders like that it's important to take your time and watch them and see what kind of differences they're making versus what you're making so here the change I want to go and really exaggerate is the timing of switching heel Edge to tow Edge so on the right here you can see that he's going and SW doing his heel Edge carve very early on before the spoon and when he's flat based well before the jump starts going up this is what I'm talking about by saying I want to be late later with my Edge because when I'm at the same part of a jump I'm in a harsh heal Edge position causing me to have a lot of sideways momentum and causing my weight to not be centered over my board where he is already set over the center of his board what this does is lets him go and load up that spin without going and getting a lot of edge pressure because you don't need to kill as much sideways momentum that's going to allow you to go and take off a lot flatter where I'm going and having my Edge really start to dig in this lets you keep your body weight all the way over and we can really see that with the head positioning where my head's looking up this way my upper body is leaning forward versus looking straight up with the body stacked all the way over the board so even though he goes and pre-s Spins here he can go and get away with it because of his flat Bas and he doesn't have any chance to go and start hooking off a jump because if he starts going early his board just pre spins what's better than digging in and drifting in these airbag situations so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and just make it so my set of carbs way sooner making it so instead of going and entering heels and then holding it for this long I'm going to enter heels sooner and then get your flat base around here and then from there transition to the tow Edge very slow I'm hoping that will let me stay more tall this is this is fundamentally a very different way of spinning than what I've been doing so it might be slightly hard to go and fully adjust but I really think that this is going to be the key and what will make me able to get my backside spins to the next level because when we go and look at the Japanese Riders let me just go and make them big here and we can highlight that they're doing the exact same thing so even vver takeoffs are pre- spinning and ver aspects of it I don't think they're as good as mine overall they're way more consistent and for working way better for what we're doing allowing them to put a lot more power so that's the difference of growing up riding dry slope versus growing up only riding snow is you don't need to worry about heel catching so you can go and maximize and get the most efficient power inducing takeoff possible so I'm studying that visualizing it and really painting in my mind this timing and the form I'll be using because this is going to be the biggest adjustment and change to my form but I'll be making this trip I am crashing so ridiculously hard it was a hectic first day uh not many first days of a Seasons I'm to going upside down two times and the only thing open is the Family Mart I got two pieces of chicken one spicy one crunchy and I got two mango smoothies so we're going to eat this and crash and the airbag doesn't open to 1:30 so going to wake up and see if I can must up energy to go again tomorrow if not going and take it as much need a day off but man that is it's tiring stuff I don't know if it's like the water's dirty but I feel I feel worked to an extraordinary level not really like tired the legs or anything tomorrow will be the test for that but just emotionally and physically drained so it was a good day uh learned a lot a lot of stuff to think about so if I need to take a day off I do not mind because a lot of the problems I was making are things that need to be solved in the head head not in the body so if we need to do that no stress but we're going to try and get a good night's sleep and then if we can get at it we will get at it thanks for watching today uh we will be doing another Vlog uh every day for the airbag trying to give you a authentic accurate feeling of what it's like to be here in Japan riding airbags and riding airbags for the first time to see if it's worth it because it is ridiculously expensive costs so much money so this is just a little show of should you do it is it important enough to actually go and spend the funds and how much can you actually get done on these airbags in a reasonable amount of time so thanks for joining me today we'll be back at it with day two coming pretty soon I'm going to try film and edit these and put them out the day they happen so that's wish me luck on that project",

But then, in order to compensate for this, I now go and pull my upper body forward towards the nose of my snowboard to compensate. And this is what pulls me naturally into the landing of the jump. So, that's how jumping works. It starts by being sunk up towards your back foot. And then as you lift off, you pull your upper body forward to compensate. So it's a rocking fluent motion, not some rigid double leg extension trying to jump up like you would for a box jump. Instead, it's flowing through. And yes, I'm still pushing with both my legs here, but I'm staggering them. Look at the bend in my front leg and my back leg. See how my front leg is more extended than my back leg here. And as that happens, I'm shifting my upper body forward, getting it over the nose. And this is a flexible motion. The steeper the jump, the more I'll need to pull my upper body forward in order to compensate for the angle and to meet up with the landing. Where if it's something like a roller, you don't need to do this nearly as much. But it's this rocking from the back foot up to the front foot that's maximizing the use of a snowboard, maximizing the range of motion of the body, letting me get maximum pop. And now let's talk about opening up that upper body. So, it's true if your upper body is too open when jumping, it's going to lead to some bad things. And the main thing is your board will try to sync up with your upper body as you leave the lip. So, watch here.",

So, I'm coming in with a straight edge and then it's cutting last second and getting more of an angle. A golden rule for backside off takeoffs and any rotation off a takeoff is you want to try hold the most gradual angle for as long as possible. So if you're going and increasing the angle of your snowboard right here at the spoon of a jump, that's going to increase your sideways momentum. So let's go a few frames forward and we'll see the ramifications of this. So I'm coming in and getting on my toe edge and right here you can see the problem. My upper body is now set slightly away from my snowboard. This is going to trigger a little bit of extra toe pressure and not let me stay as tall over top. If you're not as tall top, what's going to happen? More pressure on the toes and it's going to lead to leaning. So, here, leaning, leaning, leaning, and it's making it so in this position right here, we can really start to see that my upper body is really far away from the base of my snowboard. It doesn't seem like too big of a difference, but it really is significant. We can also see another thing and this absolutely blew my mind because I've been doing it long my whole life and that is winding up with the upper body. I always was under the impression but you want to make it so your back hand is visible from the back view. So you're trying to get it as over here as possible. But what I've noticed with these pros and the best riders in the world is they're actually doing a lot smaller of a motion. They're letting their arm come out straight and they're not overextending it. This is for a couple of reasons. The main one being if you go and pull your shoulder too much, it's going to cause it to slightly close off. And if your shoulder's closing and you're over rotating your upper body, it's going to make it so you start crunching your side right here. And this is happening. And the reason why I'm doing this is because of a whole reason I base my spins around. And I was basing my spins around throwing the arms and setting it to the angle of the takeoff.",

From here, it's all about going and practicing your full weight shift. So, on a backside 720, because we can get a little bit cked, we actually want to go expand and throw over top of our back leg. This is going to increase our range of motion, increase the dynamics on our hips, and less drive power off of the tail, giving you snap. For something like a back seven, all spins in general, you need to make sure that you're snapping off a tail so you come off a jump. And because we can get a little bit offaxis, we can drive even more power into that tail. If you're corking a backside spin, it's not coming from throwing down.

So, with that, let's jump into it. First things first for a backside 720, we need to make sure that we're getting a good angle on our heel edge and really expanding our hips to open up. This open up hip posture is going to give us a lot of range of motion to control. So then we can go and snap all the way to our tail because that's the biggest difference. A backside 720 is the first rotation where we have enough rotational degrees to be able to go and pull everything in and change the axis rotation through the spin. This is making it one of the most flexible spins for changing your axis rotation. So the whole range of motion of being a little bit more down, a little bit more taller, it's just such a flexible trick. So we're only trying to get the general gist of it. And it's also why we're like on a backside 360, we want to snap and sort of leave off here. A backside 540, leave off sort of here. On a backside 7, we want to rip our upper body all the way 90 and then have that momentum with our hips continuing all the way through back.

I really want to showcase these positions by this ollie. This ollie, you'll notice, is very subtle, but it still gets a lot of power. And that's because I'm doing a couple of things. As I go and do this ollie, instead of doing a aggressive back and forth motion, instead I just have my weight set over that back leg, upper body pulled forward. This is increasing my range of motion, increasing my balance, letting me get away with this chest open position. So as I go and pop up, alls I need to do is extend both legs. The reason why people have so much difficulty with always in jumping is because if your legs are completely centered, as you go to jump up, both legs are going to leave at the same time. So if you try to get more range of motion, it's going to extend your upper body out of this nice hinge forward position. But because I have my weight shifted over the back foot as I go and pop up, I'm naturally getting that stagger and the pop, making it so I don't need to do any complex back and forth motion. Instead, my upper body keeps the same angle, my hips keep the same position, and my upper body being angled forward will naturally pull me down into the landing. Making the oi so much more simple than if you're trying to add all these back and forth straight-legged timing. This is as simple as I'm putting my weight into my back leg. And because of the body mechanics at play, the oi naturally works. And that's what snowboarding is all about. Riding in a way that your body mechanics naturally go and make it so you can do the trick. Speaking of tricks, let's talk about rails. This is a very subtle position, but notice how my weight is slightly shifted to that back leg and my upper body is pulled forward. This makes it so as I go on pop, I'm maintaining board contact with a feature the whole time. my nose of my snowboards naturally over and because of this tilt in my upper body, it will naturally bring my nose down into the landing. And now I'm landing in the exact position I want to be in. Hip shifted back, upper body pulled forward in correlation. And this is what's giving me so much range of motion and control to channel the rotation through.",

      "fullText": "hey shredders Tavis here and in this video we're going to explain what makes allies work giving the tools you need to better perform your allies get more height more control and most importantly more style because these are one of the most fun tricks you can ever do in the mountain but you need to make sure that you're hitting the underlying fundamentals that really go and make this trick pop off [Music] the first one being making sure that you're having a slight bit of edge pressure heels toes doesn't matter not so much that your board starts turning but just enough that you can go and start loading weight onto your snowboard without worrying about washing back and forth do this simply by adding a little bit of bend on your legs and keeping your upper body slightly shifted forward or slightly shifted back in correlation the next really important body posture is making sure that your shoulders are squared this means your shoulders are in line with the tail and nose of your snowboard this is really important because if you let your chest open or close it's going to make it so you start rotating as you try to generate your pop for actual Alli motion itself it starts with this lean over position this is where I'm going and shifting my whole upper body towards the nose of my snowboard making it so my whole weight is shifted over this front foot the reason why we're doing this is because we're going to want to do a Rock motion of Leaning forward and then leaning back towards our Tails because this will go and help us Flex our board getting it more Snappy and more pop because the goal of an OE isn't going and popping up it's going and flexing your board as much as you can and letting that spring you up back to level but there's a few more things that go into play here so first of all what you need to avoid when shifting your weight forward it's only a couple things but it's really important first of all you need you make sure that your back is maintaining a straight line if you start rounding that's going to be a noo because it'll make it so you're weaker in the core and your weight is more set over your toe Edge causing you to drift when you jump and not get as much consistent power we're trying to generate straight power off of our tail so to do that we need to make sure that our weight is staying stacked over the same center partt of the board so the other thing you need to avoid to make sure that you don't lose this is hinging at the hips if you go and squat down your upper body should come down down but your upper body should never go down not in correlation of your lower body from here what you want to do is shift down into your squatted position as you're going and shifting down into your squatted position you want to go and start shifting your weight to your back foot an important note here is you don't want to squat down too much this is around the max amount of squat you want to do that's because if you start getting lower vinus you're going to be over 90 degrees and from that position it's going to be really hard to keep your weight set over your toes you're going to start leaning backwards you also just start losing effective range of motion if you go too low down so you want to just go and add around this amount of Bend in the legs I call it like 33% then as you go and hit your maximum point of sit downage that's when you start shifting your legs back and start popping upwards so we're actually going exploding off the tail of our snowboard as we shift our legs back this causes our front leg to go straight as our back leg leg keeps a little bit of Bend how we go and make sure that we don't go and land tail heavy is by making sure that we go and let our upper body shift back forward after the fact we'll go and use another clip to go and show this principle a little bit more but all these are basically all about connecting this smooth predictable movement as easily and naturally as possible you're not going to get much extra power of your snowboard by pushing harder for your legs flexing your board harder it's mostly coming from timing and fluidity so that's why every time we do an Olie the first step is making sure that you're hitting these principles correctly and from there you can start adding more power a big thing is you're probably not going to be doing too many allies just on flat ground probably just to practice so this is the perfect kind of feature that you'll be doing an OE on a little roller not much kicks so you want to generate that height yourself the reason why I'm getting so much height here is not because I'm going and jumping really hard but instead because I'm thinking about pushing off the snow see right here my board is maintaining contact with this takeoff all the way into its last possible second what this is doing is it's giving me a whole extra board length of air time this is way more air time than you'll get just naturally trying to pop up so every time you go and hit a feature like this if you want Max height it's about maintaining max pressure with your board so instead of thinking of trying to go and pop and lift yourself up off the ground instead of think of yourself as pushing off the snow trying to go and keep your board in contact with it as long as possible until it snaps off the end and this is a really good showing of what I mean about upper body positioning as I go and shift my weight back onto my back foot and start popping up that's when I go and let my upper body come back forward making it so as my legs are straight my upper body is slightly leaned towards that front foot this is what's making it so my legs come up and naturally come back in line with my body so recap on thatat if you want power out of your allies it's all about timing less leg motion and just doing everything connected here is another Prime feature that you want to do an Ollie off of and because it's so flat I can go and hit my maximum Bend so this is my absolute maximum OE position you can see that my chest is super low close to my legs that's because I need to keep my center and mass over top of the center of my snowboard and the only way to do that is to let that chest come down but even though I'm so low I'm still still keeping my spine straight not letting it round this is called maintaining your stack position and look at my glutes still not completely 90 and then from there as I go and pop up and extend my legs I shift backwards but as my legs start getting taller I go and move my upper body back to Center and look at my arm positioning here see how high we're getting this is the maximum height you want to bring your arms reason why we're bringing them up like this is to help lift our body lift our legs bring everything together but if you your arms get higher than this point it's going to actually disconnect your core muscle because even though I'm fully extended here what's happening is I'm keeping that little bit of hinge forward I'm keeping that little bit of angle and that's letting me keep my core engaged and keep my Center Mass over top of that center point of my board and that's really what I'm trying to do on every single one of the Alles is keep my weight in the exact same part of my snowboard on the takeoff through a jump and that make it so I land in the perfect spot into the landing so here's a prime example of me performing the range of motion perfectly I'd go and pop an Ollie and I maintain a stacked enough position to OE each one of these times so let's break down what's happening here so I'm starting in a pretty lean back position that's because I don't need much extra height so I'm not using that extra lean forward to back rotation instead I'm just jumping off my back foot and pay attention to my leg Bend and core Bend Bend as I pop off I'm keeping a little bit of Bend in my legs fully extended legs take time to subtract and get back together so you don't want to be using that onto a rail so I'm maintaining a bit of Bend Landing with a bit of Bend and see how neutral of a position my upper body is that lets me pop up for an OE again so this would be a great kind of oie to go and start with a very small predictable motion where you just making sure to maintain contact with what you're taking off with with your tail so here is a really good OE this is what I'd be using off a jump off of like anything for getting pop and it's simply going for my neutral stack position slightly shifting to my back foot extending and then letting my upper body come back to neutral and that's letting me stay in completely in control coming back onto my board but if you're normally hitting a rail I don't actually recommend doing an OE it gives you way too much height instead all you need to do is make sure that your boards maintaining contact with the snow so watch here watch a little my legs bent here instead I'm just focusing on keeping my tail in contact with the snow because that naturally goes and puts the nose of my snowboard over top of a rail that combined with speed will naturally syn me up to go on top of a rail no Ollie needed and that's a really important thing to note with allies when it's super fun to Max boost an alllie off the side hit allies are all about finding transition and trying to get as little impact as possible so here I'm using a little bit more of an ollie because I'm going Gap the rail so you can see the legs get fully extended but I'm still not trying to go and overp myself to lose control and this is really showing you that you can get a lot of hype through this just through timing alone so what's happening here I'm not going and shifting from my front foot instead I'm just shifting my weight to my back foot letting my upper body come back forward and then letting the kick and spring off the tail my snowboard naturally pull my legs back up to me allowing me to keep my upper body in this tight stack position what allows me to land on the rails always get even more trippy when it comes to jumps when you can all off a jump it makes it so you have a lot smaller of the surface area to go and get this pot from so here I'm doing an oy off a jump but because it explodes you off a tail it really goes and leaves your upper body behind making it a big motion so all these are really bad for trying to like combo tricks with you really just want to be doing allies alone and if you are doing an OE with a Gra you're going to need to go and make sure to really put the juice into it so we have one more OE here and this will be the final note doing it off a jump with a grab so with everything you learn in this video watch what's happening weight shifted slightly on that tow Edge shifting down slightly towards that front foot rocking to the back foot maintaining contact with the snow pushing off that lip that's naturally snapping my board in the air arms high but not too high still keeping that con constant Bend activation of the core and then from there I pull my legs up into the grab if you are trying to grab your Ollie trying to do a trick make sure to not cut your Allie motion short because your all motion is what gives you control and gives you power so that is all's explained this should be all the information you need to do a perfect OE obviously there's issues that can happen and occur along the way but if you just focus on keeping that aligned body shifting everything connect and smooth like this it'll give you a powerful Ollie that will be really fun to take on the mountain give it a go let me know how it goes and let me know if you want more information on this trick or any others I'm Tavis from snowbo explained and thank you for watching",

So, you know you did the takeoff right when it's physically impossible to grab before 230 because that's how much time it will take to catch up everything. So just a final time, train this at home. Heel edge, toe edge, extend, snap to the tail, carry that momentum all the way through while connecting the core. Hit that grab. Keep your head centered and pull through. The last part that I want to leave on is we never want to be pulling and like extending the neck. We want to keep this neck nice and stationary and only have the chest pulling and leading with that. And that with the chin being naturally angled down will give you a spot that you can do consistently. It looks silly, but you might even want to go and just practice this drill of pulling with your back arm and leading. And that's also why the mute grab is the best grab to learn backside sevens with because it goes and helps you get your shoulder in there, chest open, and lets you use your back arm to lead the spin. So grind that out through out the summer. And if you combine that with a really good backside takeoff, the backside seven is going to come around a lot easier than you'd think.

So even though he's getting crouched down here, breaking at the waist and like coming in on an angle, because he's going and focusing on getting his momentum snapped upwards and he's getting this full extension, it's not really impacting him. Again, if he tried to put like a bunch of power in of spin in this position and try to snap through it, it'd make him throw down into the ground. But instead, he's basically using like a full oie principle in order to get maximum extension and maximum height. And he's using that energy from the extra bend in the legs to lift his chest. From here, let's look at head position. So, he's taking off with his body on a very consistent angle. And this is actually how you want to cork a backside spin is consistency with the angle. So his upper body's slightly rotated towards that back foot. He's getting a nice bit of extension of the legs and he's taking off strong core and strong and that back arm is leading. His head is actually really rotated for the spot and that's making it so he's just looking around to spot at 180. This is how I do backside 540s as well. Some of the pros have found ways to spot it sooner, but uh this is the OG way and it works really good. And what's really powerful about the spot is watch his head here. See how he doesn't need to move it at all for the spot to come into the landing. And that's really all there is to a backside cork 5. If you can go and get a strong takeoff with your core extended, a good amount of pop in your legs without over popping, even if you pre-pin, even if you're leaning forward, your angle will naturally sync up with a rotation. It's one of the most forgiving axises of a rotation tricks in all of snowboarding. And that's because you can use counter rotation to finish it, adjust it, and it just feels really flexible. Then as he hits that landing, super solid blind landing, looking back up, absorbing it, perfect form, riding away, no problem. Front side seven, using exactly the same principles basically. And now we're into the POV stuff. So this is where we'll end the video. I'd highly recommend checking out rest of it because Zeb is featured and it's just a really fun watch. So I hope you liked it.

This is because his momentum is taking him on the slight angle. So if he tried to go and instantly pull his upper body facing straight downhill, it would make him a little bit edge catchy and he wouldn't be able to disperse his impact as cleanly. So that's a really important thing on landings is make sure you're landing with your whole body in the direction that you're going with your momentum. And then after that, he goes and turns and gets out of it. Then he goes into this beauty hardway front three free. Uh, one of the sickest tricks. It gets so much pop, so much power.

In the series, we go and look at my old snowwearing to figure out the mistakes I was making, address them so you can go and avoid them in your own [Music] riding. We'll start with this little front one cab one. Uh, this is a trick that I've been doing for a long time and I find it pretty natural. It doesn't use too many complex movements. Uh, the first movement we're going to be really utilizing is counter rotation and tail pressure. So, ideally, you have your upper body in this super rotated position, super bent over, but there's something that I'm doing here that's actually mistake. Even though I'm getting into the trick and lacing it, and this is happening on the takeoff, see how much my board is flexing up and over the rail. I'm going to need to go and flex my board a lot to get on top of it. Why is this? This is because of a problem that I had for a really long time and it's hitting the rail too slow because I'm landing so high up on the rail and I'm hitting it with such little speed. I'm needing to go and generate a lot of pop and a lot of height on my snowboard. I'm doing this through flexing. This is making it a lot harder of a motion. And this is also why I'm landing very tailheavy. So, we won't to stay on that too long, but basically you're going to see a lot through all my rail riding here is I was hitting all the features too slow. Here we got a little back one. And I actually didn't know how to backside 180 uh at this stage. I only really learned recently.",

This makes it so I can be light over the balls of my feet and then I can pop off that same point and that's when I'm doing such a good job here.

You did the first one and then your last one before dropping in, you were like, \"Okay, now a neutral practice one.\" Let's go. So, let's just do a back foot one. What you were doing before, like every pre-step you were doing before, it looked good. And then just the last one you did, you were like, \"Back to how I do it.\" So, back foot.",

And if you're comfortable with the back foot motion, what you should be before trying a wild cat on snow, it will come around here. My first ever uh I think this would be technically a MC twist, but it's on a very weird feature. And this works. I land it, but it's not consistent. And I've stopped doing these because this isn't a sustainable way to do it. And that's because look at my hand completely touching my board and I'm completely rounded in the back. This is causing me to to go and front flip through and land very tailheavy. So it worked in this instance, but it would never be extremely controllable and it's not something I practice now. So, this was like one day later and it was my second day riding pow jumps and I went and learned this the front under flip 540 and this actually came really natural and it sort of works better with how I do wild cats. My main problem with wild cats is I let my chest open slightly and that puts me into like a backflip axis rotation, but that works great with the under flip. So, the only changes I'm making to do the underflip here is as I throw my wildcat, I'm letting my chest completely open. And as it opens, that just will naturally put you into the position to underflip. So, if you're trying to learn front under flip fives, it's really simple. Once you get the Wildcat, instead of just throwing straight back, you're using the same principles, but letting your chest open 90. That's going to initiate a little bit of rotation, and as you hit that grab, it will come around. And again, these flip tricks aren't very technical, but they're something that you need to be like committed to and matching. And if you start like crunching, getting compromised, you're going to get funked. So, here's a pretty funny one. Uh, again, like another day after I was going ham. This was my first hit on this feature. I'm like, I want to do something cool and I was going to do an underflip, but the speed for this feature kept on getting faster and faster if each person hitting it. You can see that it's a POW in run. So, like my friends went and hit it, didn't go that big. So, I went a little bit faster and popped it. First thing I want to know about this pop, no extension, leaning back. That's not going to put me up in the air and not giving me good control. And that's why I'm going flipping through and not able to control it. Plus, I'm going too big. So, here, just completely boned and just can't control that rotation at all. I'd be able to control this rotation a lot more, though, if I got a full extension off the lip. But because I'm keeping myself crouched and I'm throwing downwards into the snow. See how I'm throwing back down into the snow instead of lifting myself up. This is making it so I'm on uncontrolled axis rotation landing flat on my face. This actually was great for building my confidence though because this day I tried double wild cats off a cliff to the side.",

But what happens a lot is people go and try to keep their center of balance over that point and they start rounding their spine.

So, nipples over the knees. And that's going to make it so as I rotate my nipples still over the knees. And that's keeping my center of balance over the balls of my feet.

      "fullText": "hey man we're going to go and break down your sters to see how you can start getting them better start feeling more controlled and move them on to bigger jumps so we're just going and watch for this video we got quite a few here pretty awesome jump line to learn these little jumps are awesome for going and locking in your fundamentals uh there's going to definitely be a few very small changes you can make that are going to be such a game Cher and make jumping so much easier for you uh I think that's enough we'll go and start breaking it down from here so we'll start with this one because recently C bias uh there's going to be a couple things that we want to change first see how you're leaned forward towards your toe Edge this isn't ideal because uh you're not in a stacked position uh you want to go and have this upper body a little bit taller less fling forward your hand shouldn't be outreaching where your Edge is and the other fing with this upper body positioning is your chest is rotated towards the jump see how Vis sh shoulders drooping down Vis shoulders drooping up this is a prime example of a little bit of lean forward with a little bit of open up a waist and that's just making it so you're not in as strong of a position as you could be so when you go and jump from here you're going from toe pressure to heel pressure a little bit uh you can see that you're evening out to this more stacked position but you're going and still having a slight little twist in your upper body it's fine on these little jumps but on bigger jumps it's going to throw you off more and it's a big reason why you're coming in and Landing heel edge here because you're going from a lean forward position to a stacked position so that's going to give you a bit of momentum shifting you from tow Edge to heel Edge causing you to go through the air and slightly shift towards your heels you always want to be landing over your toe Edge uh just because it helps you absorb the impact heels don't feel nice they don't have much cushion on them you know so uh besides that let's go and break down rest of this so starting with pop position we can see that you're going and over alling a little bit your nose is starting to go and lift upwards towards the snow uh you don't want your board to be flexing and actually alling you can Allie for extra height but for jumping for especially bigger jumps it's going to go and make you more unbalanced because when you go and load up your nose start having it Flex like that it's going to give your board more spring that spring is going to add inconsistency to your riding so you're going and having a little bit too much of an oy motion where you're going having your weight over your back foot shifting your hips forward and we can see that you're sort of going and jumping off that back foot and thrusting your hips forward through the jump we want to keep this more subtle more gentle so keeping more stacked over the board keeping less Oly and doing a bit more of a subtle pop just to make sure that this nose isn't going preul lifting off the takeoff uh we're going to go and do the next comparison comparing to one of my Straight so let's go and link up we'll do we'll do this one because this one isn't as good so it'll be good to look for example let's go and get it linked up sorry one moment the link up process isn't the easiest all right we'll do that link Zoom it in Zoom it in okay so let's compare these two starting with the in run so you can see for the in run here I'm keeping myself much more squared off with my snowboard much more stacked over top even though you see my arms coming down I'm not having my hands go and lead for rotation instead for staying right by my knees and this is my maximum bent down position and the reason why I'm bending down this much is because I'm really trying to push off get the most out of this jump so you would only be want to use this position if you're trying to get your m maximum pop less Bend of the legs would be absolutely fine here in almost every situation I wish I had a better video for example because of this but the thing I want to demonstrate here is even though I'm bending down more than you my center of mass is staying more over top of my snowboard this is because I'm letting my hips come out and I'm keeping my chest over top of my knees instead of hinging forward so you can see how your chest here is sort of coming past your knees and that's the difference between breaking waist and being stacked is if you're going and coming down and crumpling into your knees versus Lean Forward past it so this amount of bending your legs is completely fine but we need to let your butt come out more and keep your chest a little bit straighter up uh letting you go and hinge down more like a squat instead of like a lean forward to get onto that tow Edge pressure because if there's no doubt about it a little bit of tow Edge pressure does help and you can see that I'm holding a little bit of tow Edge pressure a little bit of tow Edge will make it so your board doesn't off the takeoff and that's going to give you a lot more control so we do want this little bit of Bend putting pressure on the weight we just can't have it with his chest falling forward because that's going to do a lot to unbalance us and the next thing we're going to look at here is that pop and that Ollie and this is where we can start to see the weakness of the OE because you're trying to do such a big pop it's adding in consistency and for this one it's doing a couple of things first it's making you pop off the takeoff early we can see that right here where your tail of your snowboard is leaving off a takeoff uh before it needs to this is going to lower your maximum air time it's going to limit control and this is a great indication that you're going and popping too much instead of pushing off a jump you're popping away from the jump that's going to throw you off balance and not give you the ma most height but other thing this is doing and it's really showing it for example here is because you have your weight to set over your toe Edge you lean forward as your pop it's going and putting too much pressure on the toes causing your board to slightly angle Michael Jackson style and that's where this lack of controls coming from we're going to remove the link and just look at one more of these straighter because I spotted couple more things that I want to go and mention right here is a prime example of what I'm talking about so see how you're coming up to takeoff and you're super bent over lean forward with that broken at the waist see how far away your hand is from your knees that's just to lean forward and because you're coming in this lean forward it's making it so you don't have time to fully extend and this is making you try to do a short explosive motion popping off the jump all at the same time and that's making it really hard to time so what you need to do is less Lean Forward more stacked over your board this will make it so you don't need to do as big of a motion to get off the Jump make it easier to control and your timing and next you need to go and stop thinking about popping your board off the snow instead think of it as pushing off the snow riding off it these jumps are super small so it's not going to give you too much air you can still do the all but if you're doing the all and stuff you want to be in a completely extended position as you're leaving off a takeoff not this half bent position because that's going to make you unbalanced we're going to end this off with just looking at my Straight air and seeing what aspects you should bring into your own so sorry all right Zoom it out a little bit so the first thing I want you to bring into your riding is making your stack position way less Lean Forward more tall in the chest more having your hands over your knees that's going to give you a much stronger platform but you need to find this position so you can keep that tow Edge pressure we can't throw away that toe Edge pressure so you might want to spend some time on the slope just trying to feel this position get comfortable riding in it and that will really help and the next thing I want to note for bigger jumps is you don't want to enter your squatted down position until you start going up the jump holding this position for longer than necessary is going to be hard to control hard to balance it's like a wind up for a spin you don't want to wind up super early because it's a compromised position so this bent down position is compromised a big spoon of a jump or anything like that is going to J me out so you need to wait to enter your spent down position until you go through of a spoon of a jump what's right here that little bit of flat before the up is the spoon so you can bend down through that or wait until after that to go and enter your fully bent position because straighter legs is actually more powerful and stronger next is your takeoff and extension so here I'm doing the maximum Pop I can possibly do but I'm making sure that my nose and my snowboard isn't going and lifting up so I'm not flexing my snowboard at all and that's a really important part of this popping is making sure that you're not flexing your board so how am I getting pop without going and doing the OE it's by doing a very subtle shift of weight pressure so my weight is primarily set center of my snowboard but as my nose travels off the takeoff I let my back leg keep a little bit of Bend you can see that right here I got a little bit Bend as this is straight and this is just going to let me balance as I push off and hit that final bit of extension so you can see it's a very small extension from the point my nose goes off to the point my tail goes off is a very subtle motion this little bit of bending your legs is actually the most powerful position look at like long jump high jump for all going to be jumping with very straight legs but that's because power for jumps doesn't come from fully bending down fully squatting up it comes from precise timing using that smallest range of motion to go and push and buck off the takeoff combining that with a smooth tail pressure and smooth transition will give you that strong flowy feel so you're just doing a little bit too much you're having your hips shift up a little bit shift forward and that's just adding too much momentum it really is just as subtle as being stacked and slightly shifting to your back your pressure to your back leg but you want to keep your upper body and everything forward in the same spot as normal s staying centered a good way to train this is riding off rails or riding off boxes riding off jumps just try to ride off the feature with having your tail being the last thing to make contact as your tail snaps off the end uh without bending up or down you can do that that's the same kind of balancing position you want to be doing off a jump if you start leaning to back your nose will go up if you start leaning too forward your nose will go down so use that look at that on the jumps and figure out if your board is maintaining a perfectly straight line from there the straight air should be Supernatural and come together because the point of a straight air is to have a takeoff that perfectly sets you up so you don't need to go and do any rebalancing in the air so go make those changes less Bend in the waist smaller motion and slower later to get into that bent position and try to get less Bend in that board and that should make your straight airs way easier to control let me know if you need any more feedback or when you're ready for the next advice but it's looking good and keep at it",

      "fullText": "Front one coming up, shift it over here, popping up, axis rotation set over the same point. So, that's really the secret behind this. We don't want to be completely centered because when we are, it's really hard to shift. Like, if I try to rotate here, my weight's now shifted over my front foot. I'm lifting this leg and you can see it's not too in control. But as soon as I take my hips, shift them back, I now can fully utilize rotation of the hips. I can fully utilize my range of motion of squatting down, and it gives me so much more control. So, I highly encourage before the snow hits, taking the time at home to practice neutral position, shifting the hits back, pulling the upper body forward in correlation, and then practicing as you squat down more and more, pulling your upper body forward more. And you can see it's still a little bit limited. And that's why we add that twist in the hips. And adding this twist is going to let us get lower and lower and lower. And that's really how fluidity and movement works in snowboarding. It's not from being squared like a box fog mode ready to go like sumo fight. Instead, it's being relaxed slightly over the back foot, slightly having the upper body forward, so our center balance is still set over a board. And this way, we can expand so much more range of motion back and forth. And these are going to give us all the movement dynamics that make a good snowboarder absolutely freaking fantastic. Thank you for watching the video. We'll be back at it with another one",

So, I'm sort of in the same upper body position for like nine frames. Uh, this is filmed at 30 frames per second. So,.3 seconds. I'm going to try and knock that down to like half the duration time. Try to keep that motion in the upper body moving, not holding that position at all. I think by doing that it will go and make it so more momentum is being set downwards. That's going to kick my feet up more over, making it a little more risky that you land on your head. But if you put your hand there, it should redirect the momentum and that more up and down axis is going to be more controllable because when you're playing on this sort of somewhat correct axis, the issue is you're coming through and you don't you're not rotating very much on a 180.",

If you go and throw your 360, keep your head connected and leave a takeoff like this, you're going to be thrown off and get offkilter here. That's why we actually want to take off more like a backside 180 where our hips are open, we're coming up at takeoff, boom, boom, boom, our head's coming here, we're off a takeoff, and then we channel that momentum through, get 90, rotate through, and then we can counter rotate.

I want you to think about how you can go and do a backside 90 worth of power and position your upper body in a position that'll let you use counter rotation to get the 360 around. That is the key to consistency and that is how you're going to unlock these perfect spins. So, first let's break down the in run. We want to have our approach as similar to our takeoff as possible. So, to do this, my main recommendation is taking your front hand and pulling it over to your front glute. What this does is it naturally opens your hips. But this isn't enough in itself.

So, as he tries to go and add counter rotation, his weight is now slightly shifted to his heel edge and he can't pull his upper body forward enough to compensate.

In this example, he's coming in without enough bend in his legs and upper body. So, as he pops up, he's now fully extended. And this is making it so he doesn't have the micro control on his legs to adjust his ankle angle.

      "fullText": "Sketchiness is going to make it harder to do a clean carve. But basically, we're just trying to open the board, open the hips, open the shoulders towards that corner because that's going to give us more range of motion to throw our spin. And that's going to allow us to go and keep our spot way more forward. Once you get in your toe edge, this is going to be the biggest change from a normal backside spin, and that's how low you get to the snow. A really important note I'll add to this is the kickier the feature, the less low down you need to get. But because this is such a flat roller, I need to generate all the pop out of my tail. And I also need to go and get enough pop in order to get the rotation to get back to my feet. And because of that, I need to lower myself a lot. But if this was like a high wall, think about like trying to hurdle over something low to the ground versus something high. It's easier to place your hand on something that's going to be up for more. And it's easier to spot something going forward. So, I would highly recommend learning this trick not on a feature like this, but something with a little bit more kick and a bit of a steeper drop off is going to make it a lot nicer. But what we're trying to do here is just get as low to the ground and try to get our back hand placed on the snow. We're doing this while trying to keep the base of our snowboard as flat as possible. The only way to do this is by squatting on your legs and having your upper body come forward. And this is going to be really crucial here. We don't want to round in our spine to go and put our hand down because if you round, it's going to make you too topheavy. So, it's really important to squat down with a straight back while doing this position. Straight back. Lower your legs. You can't really lower your legs past this position on a snowboard with maintaining power and keeping your body over. So, this is the limit of how much bend you really want to put in your legs. Not quite 90°. So, I would highly recommend before trying this trick to just go right around the mountain. Try to enter this position. Try to go and hold it and try to just get your hand on the snow. The while you're doing that, try to keep your spot forward. If you can go and hit any portion, even a little bit of uphill, anything, just the duration of time that you would need to be on your toe edge for going off the feature, that's going to be a massive help when actually going and trying this trick off a feature. It is going to be harder, especially downhill or flat. Like I said, it's easier the steeper up the thing's getting, but it's still worth playing around with the motion before actually trying the trick. A crucial part of this trick is the hand positioning. Your hand positioning should be as natural as possible. So here my hand is aligned with my back foot and it's right by my head. This is happening because I'm keeping my shoulders squared off and I'm not going and having my arm extend reaching backwards. Instead, I'm just having it come straight down naturally. So this hand position in line with my snowboard is just the natural position my body wants to be in without overextending. So when you're reaching your hand down, think about it like this. You're not trying to reach your hand behind you, in front of you. Instead, you're just trying to have your arm come down in the most neutral position as possible. Not trying to go and extend and knead it.",

      "fullText": "in this video I'm very excited because we're about to go over one of the most interesting and important principles in all freyle snowbo that principle is for blind Landing blind Landings are used on front side and backside spins and it's referring to how you go on spot the trick to control your rotation and control your spot it's used on every single front free every single back one and it is crucial part of freestyle snowboarding a blind Landing is referring to going and spotting the knuckle spotting the knuckle is the flat part of a jump so that's the knuckle and the reason why we're using the blind L who spot the knuckle is because it does a couple of really important things first it lets us see where we are in the air and second it lets us go and land with her body Twisted BL dispers a rotational energy a great way to think about the blind Landing is to think of trying to lock your eyes at a point in front of you follow it and keep it going throughout the motion so you should go and start with your vision squared off straight and as you pass that point your vision gradually transfers uphill you want to use a blind Landing every time your back's rotating to the downhill finishing the trick so this is true for front side 360s rotating your back it's also true for backside 180s because you're Landing with your back facing downhill whenever you do a landing with your back facing down hill using blind Landing it's important to make sure you have pressure on your tow Edge if you go and keep pressure flat base or over your heels you're going to be susceptible to clipping if you under rotate the spin and we really don't want that to be an option so the easy fit for this is to keep our body weight set over our tow Edge and as we rotate we go and keep our body weight over there and in theory if done right you can under rotate infinite around of spin with only needing to worry about the pressure on your ankles what isn't as bad as clipping an edge when you go and rotate something like a 360 your Center balance will F so right now I'm on my heels but if I kept that going I'd still keep myself on my heels so we need to redirect our AIS of rotation so when we're taking off for our front free taking off on the heels and then shifting our weight over to our toes so just like how you'd go and butter down a slope and you shift your weight we want to be doing the same thing off a jump in order to ensure that we're Landing onto our tow Edge so when we pop up we can comeb and to rotate and we'll be okay we do this by making sure of access Ro rotation is set over the balls bare feet that's just your stack position that lets you hold a little bit of edge pressure and get control and get that full FAL range of motion if you go and fully extend yourself you're not going to have the Micro Control in your core in order to readjust and shift your Edge pressure so it's really important whenever you're utilizing a blind Landing to stay tight in the core so you can pop up and keep yourself engaged in order to shift where your Edge is pointed we basically want to set our rotation on that stack position and keep that rotation through the whole point never going and losing that stack position balance rotating with in is what gives you the control and the ability to land on your tow Edge so when I'm doing a backside 180 I'm doing a couple of things first I'm keeping my spot forward at the knuckle X I'm keeping my Axis for rotation set over the balls of my feet this is making it so I can pop up spot and even if I under rotate I'll be okay and this under rotation is key because you want to be able to go and scuff if you need to so keep keeping strong spot forward coming through and pulling it around and in Fury can land with any amount of under rotation with minimal risk that said we don't want to use too much Edge pressure if you come in and use too much Edge pressure on the landing it's going to make you bble and landing on too narrow of a point it's important to land with just enough Edge pressure to rip the snow and little it but not so much you start digging in on a back five this really helps us go and Gip in the edge and slow down our rotation but something on a back one we can just go and use a very light bit of edge pressure because we don't have much rotational Force to kill the more Edge pressure you use the more it will stop your rotation and the less you use the more you'll be likely to slip out so if we pop off don't use any blind Landing or anything we're going to continue to slip out if we do a front side 360 without using anything we're going to continue to spin cab and you can see how bad make me super at risk of catching my toe Edge because my momentum doesn't stop that's why we want to go spot forward lock it and hold that blind Landing longer than you would think whenever you're utilizing a blind lding it's important to move your head as little as possible you want to set your head in front of you and keep your head in a stationary Point as you rotate your head around it so I'm not trying to go and look with my head or move my head around head here shift where I'm looking a bunch because that's going to disorientate me and throw me off you're trying to set your view straight in front of you and have your body rotate around that point this is true for things like Butters as well putting my spot here keeping it here and tracking it the whole way and that naturally sets you up for the blind Landing we're not going and trying to rotate and then extend because that's going to go and throw or Center mask over a board remember when you're doing anything like this any Landings any takeoffs you're trying to keep your weight centered over your snowboard you leave off your tail but you land centered and when we're going and doing the blind Landing you can have a tendency to land looking too far back up hill so remember keep your point in front of you track it and rotate your body around your spot and that's going to give you so much more control and flexibility the main thing you need to avoid to use a blind Landing is throwing too soon if I try to do a back one and rotate my upper body too soon I'm not going to be a to track in front of me because I'm rotating past the point I'm trying to track so if you find yourself going and pre-s spinning with a front free if you're pre-s spinning it's going to make it so you lose that ability to spot the knuckle and you need to go and look around your shoulder and to see so that's why whenever we're utilizing these Bland Lings we want to pop up chest forward towards the jump so like you never want to snap more than your 90° position this is his max range as you have once you rotate further than that range your head's going to be positioned here and that's going to make it so you have to spot the takeoff of the jump instead of the actual knuckle of the jump for backs side it makes it so you go and turn and you're stuck in this position looking uphill and you won't be able to go and keep your spot so you need to look over making it so you throw off a whole trip so on a front side 360 if I go and rotate my upper body too soon go and try to get to spun off to take off it's going to leave my spot over there and disconnect me on a backside 180 if I go and turn off the takeoff I have no ability to spot the knuckle and this is why it's so important to keep your spot up in front of you so that way you're tracking over top of where you're going you need to keep that spot up in front travel over it and then fall with a blind Landing all keeping your weight centered over your board it's also really important to not look up too soon you want to pop up and hold that blind Landing even longer than you think you need to really go and kill your full rotational momentum on that impact because that's going to make it so you can go kill it right away straight giving you so much more control pop up look at it lock in right away then pop up if you like this video and want to see more videos like it please leave a comment it really helps boost engagement get this

So here, I'm combining extra lean forward because I'm like, \"Oh, I'm coming in blind. I want to make sure to not catch my heels.\" and I'm letting myself land a little tail heavy because I'm not getting a full rotation. So, if I felt like I had time, I'd pull my hips back into the landing here. You can see both feet are landing at the same time. So, the reason we want to be shifted over our back foot is because it greatly increases our room for air. Here, I get a little noseheavy because I go a little bit bigger than expected and I'm not landing at the point.

Uh, sure, you could go on a heel edge, but when you're trying to gap this much and you're going off a heel edge, like we were talking about, you put more power into that, try to pop more, it's going to make you want to drift. So, what does he do to counter this? He sets his whole board on the angle towards the feature, then goes toe edge, and that goes and straightens out his angle onto the feature.
