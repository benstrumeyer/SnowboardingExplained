Knowledge is power. So, in this video, we're breaking down the funniest snowboard fails compilation to see what we can learn. What the That is the prime example of do not go early for your rotation, even on a ride onto a rail. That is so punished. I'd be lying to if I said I never slammed like that, but that no way that guy's walking out with anything but a couple broken ribs. Like, that was ridiculous. What's happening here? just throwing straight down. Okay, this clip's iconic. So, we're going to break it down from the start because this is maybe one of the most disturbing videos on the entire internet. So, it's not starting good. The guy's coming for a massive gap feature. That means he's going to do a lot of power into it and he's completely shifted back onto his back foot. When a little bit of shift back on the back foot's good because it helps you pop up the tail. We don't want our whole weight set back there. The angle on this is ridiculous. So, as he comes off the lip, he gets ged out. Shot out. But first, worst back taco in all history. Hitting it, getting absolutely folded. I don't know the ramifications of this slab. But this, you can't let that happen. That is so ridiculously brutal. And I hope that guy is still snowboarding today. I probably wouldn't be, dude. What? I honestly haven't ever found a good like fail compilation for snowboarding on the internet. And this guy, I think he just has all the clips. So, pre- spinning and you do want to have your weight set over your toe edge when you're popping. But because he's overextending his legs, he doesn't have that micro control in the ankles to keep the board tilted upwards. So, as he comes in, the toes just hit and he gets flung so hard. So, a little bit of an over snap, a little bit of an overextension. Like the head shouldn't be over here on a front free. It should be over here with pushed shoulder. So, this guy could have been easily avoided. Maybe he was trying like a front side 540 and really trying to get a lot of rotational power, but that was ridiculous. Some natural feature double drop into what? That guy just kept falling forever. That's okay. We got Mississippi count this. This is how I judge air time. For reference, like the biggest cliff I've ever done is like 2.2 seconds of air time. So, one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three almost three Mississippi. So, that's like almost as big as the X Games jump. Just straight flat light flat. That was brutal. Okay. Okay. We got to slow down here. Too many people are dying too fast. So, 50/50. Upper body a little disconnected. Front arm leading causing the chest to open a little bit. Oh, and he tries to pop into that kink extending too soon. Clipped. Oh my god. And just flung. Oh, that's a concussion. I feel sorry for that dude. Oh, okay. That one's That's going to happen. Looks like he broke his wrist, though. What? Where? What? Where did this guy come from? Backside board slide. Oh, just completely leaned over. This happens a lot when you're trying to get onto something high. You'll like lean into it. Remember, we need that vertical up and down. Lean. That's too lean, man. You lean too much. Oh, powder. I like the powder ones because they can be good slams and the person isn't necessarily like having the worst day of their life. So, when we see someone die on rails, it's normally like a little bit of anxiety laugh. This This is just fun. Just hit that pillow a little short, got bucked, not good proper position. That guy's fine. He could get up and try it again. No tweak, no style. Mad Tommy, don't go for a method when you don't have a lip to pop it on something that big. Bad trick choice did not work out. Oh, this happens all the time. This is like doesn't hurt in powder. The most normal slam you can get. Notice how the landing's really flat here. You need to have yourself so ridiculously angled onto that back foot in order to like hit it and push through the snow. So most of the time when you go and hit a powder jump like this, you're going to go over the nose, especially in flat light. Those ones on chill. Yeah, he's still riding. He's having a good time. Yeah. A little toe heavy. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Dude, not not too shabby. Not many people can get five extensions throughout a front side 360. And this is just one of those things when you're learning a new jump, learn a new kick, a lot of things can go wrong. Uh it's going to be something to do with a takeoff. Let's see if we can notice anything here for when we're filming our big back country projects. So upper body super open, not really generating any rotation. This is generally fine on a big jump like this. You have so much air time, you don't need much snap. But I think it's just a little too set back for how kicky the jump is. And that's making it so Yeah. And now he's keeping his spot forward. So actually a little bit too rotated. I think he would have needed to go and have his chest a little bit less open, more range of motion. So he could have kept the spot more forward because see how he's like rotating past the point he can spot. So the rotation is actually just set too fast there. Would have needed to go and snap it way less hard even though way less chess open position. Yeah, just should have done a double. Oh, this is actually no joke. This is like the worst way to fall on your snowboard. Feet over. That's like That's danger for the spine. Uh people aren't generally trying to land that way, but you really don't want to let it happen. Mhm. Oh, back one on that spot. That's brutal. That's a brutal spot, guys. Like, what are you guys thinking? So, okay, I understand hitting it like in this direction coming over here. There's a big landing pillow. This is half a length. Like no pillow here. Why did he go and try to land on that left side? That just doesn't make any sense. And it looks like it's straight into like an uphill ditch landing. What? Why are they hitting this? Launching over everything straight angle straight into uphill with no landing available. Okay. Okay. That that guy had it coming. What's this feature? What is this street? Is this a park? Who was building this? Have to clear a fence fighting arena into a death gap. This guy's honestly so lucky he made it that far. Like that's a gnarly looking slam, but I bet he's pretty okay with it. Like going to be banged up, but I've seen worse. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So pillow feels seem fun, seem floaty, but if you land right on top of it, you're just hitting an uphill landing. So good clip, just a little bit big. That's going to happen when you're riding pillows and committing to a blind trick. Oh. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. This the flattest landing ever. Well, this landing position leaves something to be desired. See how his upper body is like pulled forward, not really squared over the tail. legs are the same amount extended. Uh doesn't really have a body dynamics going to be able to absorb something like this. Me personally would ride away from that with some serious D's. Put me in their coach. This is too flat. No, you got really lucky. I hit a tree slightly last year and it really hurt. I wasn't even doing anything cool. I was just trying to post up to film a homie. That's a good one, man. These are so many good clips. I don't know if we can react and break down each one of these. This is a lot of skier. What? What? So, in skiing, that's actually just a make. Uh, you count that. See how ski stayed on? That counts. That was maybe the most insanely fast tomahawk I've ever seen. Back five. That's going to happen when you under rotate a back five. Undershoot it. Len. What the dude? People are out here trying to get airtime. Jeremy Dubs. All right, Jeremy Dubs. Great. You got that clip, Jeremy Dubs. Good. You put your credit in there. Oh, that's a pretty sick feature. Sidewall pull up into Tommy Destruction. Oh my god. Again, I'm pretty sure that's just what they're trying to do. I'm not sure. I'm not a skiing expert. Oh my god. That that would happen on any sport. That's why it's really important to send your tricks upwards instead of across. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's a mating ritual. I'm not again not a big skier. Again, I think that's a make. Uh not an expert on skiing or anything. Uh, see there I think he was aiming for actually the other jumps landing. So just a little too slow. Pretty normal in skis. Uh, they don't ride very fast. So it's hard to get the speed for it. Homer seen it again. So coming up Jean out over the toes. Front roll. Good style. If he just went like 800 feet bigger could have landed it. All right. This is what I'm talking. So, really cool feature, really cool idea why he decided to hit it angled towards where you don't want to be at the far side of the takeoff. Eluds me, I must say. Uh, yeah, probably would have been better to take off on the tow edge for that one, my dude. Anyway, cool spot. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. That's embarrassing for him. Oh, I bet he landed that because out of shot landed. Oh. Oh, that is brutal. So complete overshoot. Slightly leaning forward the whole way. Coming down. Oh my god. compressing straight into the spine. This is That might be a broken back. That is disturbing. Oh my lord. Holy moly. Oh, it's moving around like he might have been okay. Coming up. Upper body really rotated. Counter rotated. Oh yeah. Oh, into 270. I don't think that's going to go, dude. The issue here, look at the bands. They're not nearly big enough. You can't get that much lower and upper body separation in that skinny pants. He's gonna go zech it. I bet heel hook. Oh, fro. Didn't even get into heel hook position. If he put on be your pants. Uh, I can guarantee. Is that Shawn White? I don't know. That is Shawn White, dude. Why is Shawn White getting so worked on a cab, too? Must be the pants. Sorry, dude. No way. That's Shawn White. That's fake news. Fake news there. Front board on the staircase. Toe catch. Head slam. That's why I don't ride stairs. I always make the comparison. Uh I don't get why you take all the time to shovel off stairs when you're trying to ride street features. I personally just like keeping razor braids in my pocket. So if I slam it has the same effect. You're just getting hurt. Makes it more gnarly. Don't take the time and the extra labor to shovel up the stairs. It's too much work. Just put something sketchy in your pockets. This is actually sick. That is really good form. Really good posture. Getting the nose up and over. Boom. Super blunted. Super sick. Oh, just such a brutal kink. Uh yeah, no fault to the rider here. That was looking money. And she was risking it for the biscuit. That was pretty dope. Oh yeah. Sniper landings. I used to go for sniper landings, but they're punishing when you miss. So, these guys made themselves a feature pretty perfect for getting destroyed on kicky takeoff, high fence. So, we need to get up and over this fence. We saw already in the previous clip the guy clipped the fence. So, you know, more speed. But the problem is with the mathematics of the trajectory, uh, getting over the fence here seems to result in an overshoot. See how he hardly cleared the fence yet he is completely boned already. I think these guys probably should have built the takeoff a little bit more kicky. Honestly, good landing position. I think this guy thought he was going to ride away from it. Boom. Hips open. Absorbing. Nice. Straight up and down. Straight vertical. Oh yeah. Wear a mouthguard if you're going to send a feature like that. That's all I can say. Mhm. Pretty classic. Street. Everyone's favorite. Everyone, if you're looking to have a casual, fun time snowboarding, get into street. Everyone loves it. You're happy the whole time. There's nothing bad about riding street. This feature just Oh, yeah. So, hips are shifted back, right? Landing over the tail, but his upper body is just too forward. That's a hard jump and hard angle to sink up. So, can't blame the guy, but I'm sure he went back and got that one. Just that's a tough hip angle to get in feature. Oh, that's a pretty sick spot. Pull jam. Mhm. Mhm. Pull jams are really cool in theory. In practice, a little bit much. What? Dude, these are some Oh my god. Sorry. Had to pause it. That's just slammed his face in there. Wear a helmet, kids. Jeez. Mhm. Mhm. Little nollie action. Yeah, we don't. Falls like Van Powder. Not even count as a slam. Under shoot. Nothing to say there. Just getting bucked. Oh. Oh, dude. Dude trying to boards slide the tree. Vatossy the tree trying to board. Honestly, just respect. Sure. taught caught toes. Probably could have avoided a toe catch. Like upper body is way too sunk of a back foot here. Like pull it over. Give yourself some range of motion to use those ankles, man. You're sliding a mossy covered tree. What do you think's going to happen? Uh, so end of the story. I would Oh, fist features. Ridiculous. So, great pop. Obviously, a really fantastic snowboarder. Just cooked her a little close to a tree. Uh uh uh. But I probably would have landed that. Good head position. See how his head's maintaining a centered position? He's not leading with it. Really good foundation. Honestly, bro, respect. Go back. Hit my tree again. You'll get it. And rewind time. Like what? 20 years. Nice. Nice. Nice. Front dub 10. pull out. Ah, that's a thing with front dub 10. You got to commit. Lobster flip. Oh, dude, I remember this. This is some OG. I'm pretty confident this is held. I actually have no idea how this trick works. Uh, looking at the actual takeoff, every aspect of snowboarding tells me this is a bad take off. Fully extended, fully elongated, completely set over that tail of a snowboard. Not good. Coming in tucking and then a little normal and then trying to elongate it. Uh uh respect respect getting that one, but I don't think that's going to be one that you'll narrow down into a science very often. Uh this is a reverse bathtub, I guess, going over to your back. I think that's actually happened to me once. Just taking off way too heel heavy. You're boned. You take off a big jump like that, heel heavy like that. That's going to happen. But it's a nice enough transition. Way too much toe pressure here. What's going on? Angled forward straight on the toes. Don't take off a pal jump on your toe edge like this. Upper body open. This is exactly what's going to happen. That's exa that was going to happen the whole time. I don't know why you did that. Oh, dude. Street's so punishing. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I like, but if they put a little bit of snow here, maybe a couple more shovels would have been a little beneficial, but you know, got to get the clip. Time constraints and stuff. Fair. Fair. Oh my god. Oh my god. I hope that's not the same person waving up three times. Dude. Dude. Dude. Okay, so this is just getting bucked. Upper body way too far forward. Like you need the upper body forward because it's so kicky, but just getting compressed at that position. Oh, that's a brutal feature honestly. And no landing. Whoever built that feature is honestly such a tool. That is not a That is not a nice thing to build. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. All right. Oh, dude. Sorry, guys. This is really painful to watch right now. The double shinner. Oh my god. So, this is why it's so important to uh keep balanced over your legs and not try to fight it. Look at that. Oh, right on the knees, too. Other than just insult to injury face plant. I don't know how educational this video is for people if I'm being honest here, but actually is really fun to watch coming into the season and just motivates me to know that you can slam and get away with it. You know, we're always trying to avoid slams, but these guys did it and at least some of them have survived. So that's encouragement. Yeah, I don't think we're leaving this. One second. One second. What the? So overall impressions of this position? Pretty good. Shifted back. Chest forward. Completely centered. Not bad. Not bad. Let's see how the extension goes. So lifting the chest, getting quite a bit of an extension here. The issue I'm seeing here is even though the hips are shifting back, the upper body is still pulled forward towards the front foot quite aggressively. Mhm. Mhm. Then when they pop up Yep. So upper body a little too far forward and that's just causing a slow tilt generally if you tilt towards your toe and he goes for a grab. This guy does his takeoff. Feels good enough about it, but he goes for a stalefish grab. Dude, so the thing with snowboarding is you don't really know how flexible of a human you are until this point right here. But once you can make a perfect circle, you know you hit some goals. Uh yeah, I was just a little greedy going for the stalefish grab on that takeoff. Sorry, Matt. I think I think you deserve that one. That's count. That's a make. I count that every day. That's what he's been working on. I know this dude. He's been training that, grinding it all day. Let's see this again. This is just This is art. Like freaking pick your favorite street rider. They're not pulling this trick off. This clean this move. I heard this was first te as well. So just one of the most iconic tricks. You can see just really aggressive getting onto that rail. Weight completely shifted back. Exactly like you want. And then look at that head. Maintain a nice stable position, strong, not lean here. This is where most mortals would pull their neck back and try to reach for it, but that would actually elongate your core. And since your legs are already over, you have enough weight going. So the secret here is just keeping centered and being patient. And man, he does that so well. See how he lets his board crunch towards his face and that gives him the rotation needed. And look it because he's using counter rotation here, he's able to go and pull it back and ride out so clean. Boom. Perfect blind landing. That is how it's done. I don't know why that's in a fails compilation. That's just textbook textbook to me. Uh, wow. Oh, it's a Sorry, it's a she. Uh, I'm just border or not border, you know? And then I just use dudes. That's just sort of how it works. You're either a border or you're not. That's sick. That's a sick spot. I don't I don't mess with jumps in between trees. Even if that big of a landing, just not worth it, man. If Mark Wamorris can hit a tree, you can hit a tree. Don't. Nice. Well, video's rounding up. We're finishing it. No smarter. No wiser. didn't learn anything. But man, it is cool to see what people are out here doing. And remember, sometimes it's okay to take some time, get fundamentals, get the steey clips. We don't always need to go and risk our lives on every single feature. And when we do, it's good idea to put some serious thought into it and try to eliminate some variables because some of these things, that's the biggest thing I'm seeing here. Most of these could have been easily avoided through any step of a process. That's a pretty sick feature, though. That's That's worth it, dude. That's worth getting bonked to four. Yep. All right. Well, thanks for watching. Uh if you want to see more videos like this one, uh someone's going to make another one of these complations because as far as I know, this is the only one that exists. So, yeah. We'll see you next time.
