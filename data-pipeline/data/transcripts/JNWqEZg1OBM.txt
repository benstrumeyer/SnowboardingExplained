It's a beautiful early season day, but because 
it's early season, there's some pretty sketchy conditions and sketchy sessions. So, in this 
video, I'm I'm going to teach you how to ride early season conditions, how to deal with the 
sketch, and what to look out for. I'm going to use this run to explain the three principles I 
base my early season riding around. And that's bean stack over top of a snowboard. Making sure 
I'm not leaning in one direction or the other. Because there's a lot of warm weather, there's 
a bunch of chunks. There's going to be sections of ice that no matter how good your form is, no 
matter how good of a snowboarder you are, you're not going to be able to hold an edge through 
them. Right now, it's a decent top section, but as we get lower where it's been more melted, 
it's going to get harder and harder. So, the most important thing is to go and keep ourselves 
compressed over top of our snowboards. And this is going to make us more stable and able to 
handle little icy sections if they come at us. And then the next thing we want to do is really look 
where we're going. Watching where we're going is so key because there's going to be good sections 
of snow and bad sections of snow. So like here there's a little bit of fluff. It's decent. Not 
too bad. So like this actually looks pretty sick. and we can launch it. Knowing that there's some 
bumps afterwards. So, planning out your turns, where to carve, where to slow down, where you 
can set an edge is so important during this time of season. So, like now that we're in a mogul 
field, planning is going to be so important. And you're going to see a lot of mogul fields 
like this at the start of the year. And you'll notice through the actual mogul themselves, it's 
so icy. I can't hold an edge. Even traversing, I'm absolutely getting wrecked. But when I look 
at these, I can see that there's more snow to the left and there's more snow on top. Like that's 
a very normal fall. Like here, I'm just going to want to go across actually sliding across the 
tops of a mobile field because there's a little less ice while keeping myself stacked over top of 
a board, planning and looking for a good section to go and slow down. No matter how good you are, 
this is going to be hard to ride through. And now that I see it's clear, there's good snow ahead. 
I can just bomb and charge through. Stay flat face. And now I'm looking for a soft patch of 
snow. I'm going to go and slow down using it. And the last thing is we want to keep oursel low 
in our snowboard, but with proper body mechanics. A lot of people when they hear, "Oh, belowing a 
snowboard," they think, "Get down. Get completely squared." Well, demo in the deck. This is just 
some rocky terrain. I took decide to come on here. This is going to be a little bonus section just on 
the importance of good form and how you actually want to use this position to load powerful because 
it's going to make things so much easier. So, first of all, I want to say this form is what 
I use for pretty much everything. jumping, it naturally sets you up. Carving, it lets 
you get you lower and it's just going to be a really powerful building block that will actually 
take you to the next level of snowboarding. It's flexible and best done with other movements, but 
woohoo, it's really what you want to think about and ground yourself over. A lot of people think 
that this is the strong position, squared in the board, and when I squat, I keep my chest up and 
squat down, but this is going to make me fall back because it relies on leaning. And when it's 
icy, we really don't want to be leaning. There's actually three motions that go into doing a proper 
low down squat position that will let you utilize your turn. First is a little bit of opening of 
the hips. When we're squared, it's going to be restricted and it's going to be tough to expand 
our body. But as soon as we open our hips a bit, it now lets us drop our weight. We'll stay 
in more over top of our snowboard. The next part is instead of keeping the spine straight, 
what's going to make it so as we squat down, our weight shifts more and more to the heels, 
what will make us lean. Instead, we want to have our hips back and a little bit of hinge forward. 
So that way now when we squat down, we're really loading our weight onto it. And then the last 
thing is doing all these motions in correlation. So the more I want to get onto that edge, the more 
I can open my hips, the more I can drop my body, the more I need to pull out my hips. That's moving 
with all three of these movements in correlation. That's let you really load an edge and lock in. 
And that's going to be really important when carving in these really icy conditions because 
if we try to push out and lean, as soon as we hit ice, we're going to slip out. So, open the 
hips, pull them back, drop the upper body forward, chest over the knees, and that way when you squat 
down, it will expand into this motion, loading so much pressure onto that edge while keeping your 
weight still over set your board. And I personally like letting my hips shift back a little bit. You 
can have your hips forward if you want to do like faster turns, but I like a little bit of set back 
weight because I do a lot of jumping and a lot of alling. And when you're like back centered and 
you do a jump, both feet. But when you do this position, upper body forward, hits back, and you 
do a jump, it naturally is you off the tail and pulls you to the nose. So, I just like it as the 
base of all my snowboarding. I'm going to make more videos on this, but I just figured it's 
important context for the rest of this video. So, that's what I'm talking about. Some ice 
is just too icy to stand on. There I was just putting on my mitt and got taken out. So it can 
get you if you're not aware for it. And that's where like early season like people are getting 
biffed on this ice patch. So that's why we want to make sure our stance is like over so we can like 
tackle it without relying on leaning. As soon as you're leaning back on one of these slopes, you're 
going to be boned. So last lap I explained the three principles. We want to be over top of our 
board. We don't want to be setting our edge by leaning. And we want to be watching where we're 
going and planning our turns. And in this run, I'm going to go and demonstrate how I use them. 
So Alli's vigilant, Allie's watching. Here, there's a little more snow, less traction, so 
we're able to go and hold an edge and actually feel more comfortable on our board. The sideburn, 
not going to be nearly as queued out. When we're going through here, we want to go and look for 
those soft patches of snow while keeping stack. And the thing that makes this position work is 
shifting your hips slightly to the back foot and the upper body over. This lets me go and get 
a lot lower. And from here, if I do slip out, I'm going to slip out onto my bum instead of 
like falling. When we get into the mogul field, this is going to be more important. And because 
we're shifted back, it's going to let us move our legs really independently to our upper 
body. And this is going to give us that micro control. So if we feel like we're slipping 
out here, we can adjust it really easily. So, notice how my upper body's forward, hips 
back, and now I'm able to squat low while keeping myself over top of my board. Holding 
that forever is going to be really tiring. So, we want to go and fluctuate in the good snow, we 
can relax it, calm it, and then as it gets worse, we want to crouch it down. And this is 
actually the same position we want for jumping. Now we're getting to a little bit of a steeper 
section and so it's going to be more icy like here completely sheer ice and it's bumpy afterwards. 
So planning is going to be really important. I'm going plan going to a right side ice match here 
flat base. Slow down. And now I can straight bomb through here because I see the smells good. 
Depending on the lighting, this is going to be a lot harder. And that's why bad lighting 
and bad ice are the double combo that really makes snowboarding tricky, no matter how good you 
are. We're getting into a mogul field and this is perfect for what I'm trying to demonstrate. Way 
too icy throughout the sections. I can't hold an edge at all. This is a sketchy situation. Let me 
go and demonstrate first how to get up if you fall because falling is going to happen when you're on 
ice like this. So, if I fall here and get slipping on my bum, I don't want to try jar my legs forward 
to stop it. Here, it's working because it's not so steep. I actually want to pull my legs into me 
like this. So, I'm on my back and I'm pulling my legs into me. So, I'm in this strong position 
here. And that's going to let me absorb it. Like here, I can really dig in my foot. I can use my 
hands. That's going to let me control it. And that's why we want to be a little more crouched 
down when we think we could be falling so we don't get the wind shook out of us and slam and need to 
navigate. Now just keeping my board, keeping over top of my board, watching where I'm going. And 
the important thing here is like ride for what the conditions offer. I'd love to lay some really 
long turns, but instead I got to stay stacked, control speed, put my weight really solid over 
top of my board by pulling my upper body forward, shifting the hips back, and that's going to 
let me navigate this terrain a lot easier and being safe this early season. That's 
the most important thing. This is the time of year where you can get hurt and get 
bucked for absolutely no good reason. So, you want to go live by these same principles. 
Look where you're going. Don't lean away from your snowboard. And lead the turns through weight 
shifting instead of going and putting yourself in a compromised space. Oh my god. And don't lower 
your guard. If you do that, you should be able to navigate bad terrain and the early season 
with relative ease. Relative is a key word
