10:14 a.m. Thanks, man. Okay, so because of 
current conditions and lack of snowfall, it's only Blackout Mountain that's open and it's 
only this one run. So, everyone's going to be going up Jersey and taking this one run down. I 
don't think it matters how good you get. If you take six months off riding, there's always going 
to be a part of your head that's like, "Fuck, do I still know how to snowboard?" Uh, the answer is 
usually yes, but sometimes it takes a little bit to get into. New boots that maybe are the hardest 
part of a new ski season. Oh, but we're ripping. Oh, yeah. Snow's pretty off. Good crunch layer. 
It's a little bit crunchy. So, I always find that my edges ripple a lot harder. Like, I feel 
a lot more sensitive at the start of the season. We'll go hold the side. It's bumpy, but not so bumpy that you can't go and 
time up your turn. Ice patch there. Feels good to be back. Oo, that's a bad spot to be 
sitting right under the hill. Not really anything for sidehill so far. A 
little something here. Going to have to be extremely careful on everything you ride right 
now though, just because there's so many people. So, you just have to be really careful 
these ridges because we're so shallow and there's so many rocks that some are looking 
a lot more tempting than they actually are. Oh, it feels good to be back, man. So, you need to be really careful venturing 
off because there really isn't the snow. Okay, we'll have to get over through these people. That is disgusting. Honestly, just so 
brutal. We can get up a little bit, try to get to people aren't making a 
fourack, but it's pretty condensed. Yeah, no worries. I'll kick up my foot. Whoa, 
that's tight. That's a lot of people. That's a lot of people. That's discouraging thinking about 
doing another run. Yeah. That was long. That was like almost 30 minutes, I think. Yeah, I think 
so, too. They're not joking about being careful about venturing off trails today. Yeah. Like, and 
then they made announcement that like if if you go across the I don't know, across the like sign. 
Yeah. They're not going to help you. They're going to not going to save you. That's fair. Yeah. 
I heard some people are hiking to seventh, but if you go all the way to seventh, but like 
seven heavens. Yeah. But it seems risky right now. It is pretty risky. Legs are starting to feel 
a bit better. Boots are warming up a little bit, but egg still feels very sensitive. 
Oh, this is pretty sick bridge. Oh, sick. A little something. There's always fun to be had across the mountain. You know 
which you look. Okay, ice cookies. Oh. Oh, what's this? Oh my god, I am sketchy on the board 
for first day. That's to be expected. Oh, that's a little fin for my blood. It's like really crunchy rolly ball ice 
underneath a little bit of sticky soft snow. Not the worst snow conditions, but I 
would not trust a serious hard carb right now. All right, let's take this with some speed. I am sketchy on my board right now. Popping too hard. I always 
find that start of a season, you just feel like you need to do so 
much to try to get that height where really less is usually more. Nothing 
over here. Let's check out to the left. Uh man, this run feels so 
short. So short for that weight. Little triple pop. Nothing here to really get 
any serious juice off of. Be a little careful. We'll get a little cheeky with it. Oh man, it's just so slushy, so grippy. There's 
a singles line. Absolutely humongo. Consensus on opening day. And this is what it's going to 
be like into the open war list. It's around 40 minutes for a lap, 5 minutes riding, 30 minutes 
in line conditions. It's a little warm. There's a bit of snow. You do not want to venture too 
far off trail. Some people have been doing it, but honestly, it is a pretty crappy opening day. 
There's always fun to be had on the mountain, but just the amount of work and time it 
takes to wait is making it sort of not too ideal. That said, let's try to get 
some redemption on this hit. Boost it. But there's still fun to be had. I'm 
gonna go home. Wait for a better day.
