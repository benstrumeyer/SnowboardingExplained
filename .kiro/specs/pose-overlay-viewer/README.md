# Pose Overlay Viewer - Complete Specification Package\n\n## What You're Getting\n\nA complete, production-ready specification for a 3D pose comparison tool that solves a real coaching problem: \"My coach is 6' and I'm 5'6\" - how do I actually copy his form?\"\n\n**Total Documentation**: 59 KB across 5 comprehensive documents\n\n---\n\n## The Idea (30 seconds)\n\nExtract 3D pose skeletons from two videos (rider + coach), normalize them to a shared coordinate space, scale for body proportions, and render in 3D with full camera freedom. This lets riders see exactly how their form compares to a coach's, adjusted for body size.\n\n**Result**: Riders learn tricks 2-3x faster with visual, objective feedback.\n\n---\n\n## The Documents\n\n### 1.

Extract 3D pose skeletons from two videos (rider + coach)\n2. Normalize both into a shared 3D coordinate space\n3. Optionally scale the reference pose to match rider's body proportions\n4. Render both skeletons in Three.js with full camera freedom\n5. Align playback by normalized phase time (not raw frames)\n\n**Result**:\n- Ben can see his skeleton overlaid on his coach's skeleton (scaled to Ben's height)\n- Coach can point to the overlay and say \"see how my legs are more bent here?\"\n- Ben can see the exact angle difference\n- Ben adjusts form and tries again\n- Ben learns the trick 2-3x faster\n\n---\n\n## Why This Matters\n\n### For Riders\n- Learn tricks 2-3x faster\n- Get visual, objective feedback\n- Understand exactly what to change\n\n### For Coaches\n- Give better feedback\n- Coach multiple riders with different body sizes\n- Remove subjectivity from coaching\n\n### For You (Developer)\n- Solves a real problem\n- Cross-sport applicable (gymnastics, dance, martial arts, etc.)\n- Strong portfolio piece\n- B2B potential (coaches, gyms, sports teams)\n\n---\n\n## Technical Highlights\n\n### Coordinate Space Normalization\n- Use PCA to find principal axes of each skeleton\n- Rotate both to align axes\n- Translate to shared origin\n- Scale by body proportion ratio\n\n### Synchronized Playback\n- Normalize both sequences to [0,1] phase time\n- Interpolate frames at normalized time\n- Snap key moments (takeoff, peak, landing) together\n\n### Body Proportion Scaling\n- Extract body proportions (height, arm length, leg length, etc.)\n- Compute proportion ratios\n- Scale position-based signals\n- Keep rotation-based signals unchanged\n\n### Real-Time Rendering\n- Render skeletons as line segments\n- Minimal geometry (100 triangles)\n- 60fps on mobile devices\n- Full camera freedom (rotate, zoom, pan)\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: MVP (2 weeks)\n- Side-by-side skeleton rendering\n- Synchronized playback\n- Basic camera controls\n- Play/pause/scrub\n\n### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (1 week)\n- Overlay mode\n- In-place motion mode\n- Speed control\n- Frame-by-frame navigation\n\n### Phase 3: Body Proportion Scaling (1 week)\n- Scale reference to match rider\n- UI toggle\n- Visual feedback\n\n### Phase 4: Polish (1 week)\n- Performance optimization\n- UX refinement\n- Documentation\n\n---\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n### MVP\n- [ ] Load two skeleton sequences\n- [ ] Render side-by-side in Three.js\n- [ ] Synchronized playback at normalized phase time\n- [ ] Play/pause/scrub controls work\n- [ ] Camera rotation works\n- [ ] 60fps on target devices\n- [ ] Mobile responsive\n\n### Full Feature\n- [ ] All MVP criteria met\n- [ ] Overlay mode works\n- [ ] In-place mode works\n- [ ] Body proportion scaling works\n- [ ] All controls intuitive\n- [ ] Documentation complete\n- [ ] Coaches validate usefulness\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks: LOW\n- Coordinate normalization: Well-documented technique (PCA)\n- Three.js rendering: Mature, proven tech\n- Frame interpolation: Simple math\n- Body proportion scaling: Straightforward algorithm\n\n### Integration Risks: LOW\n- Uses existing pose data\n- No new ML required\n- Proven tech stack\n- No external dependencies\n\n### Overall Risk: **LOW**\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n**Build it.**\n\nThis is a high-value, low-risk feature that:\n1.
